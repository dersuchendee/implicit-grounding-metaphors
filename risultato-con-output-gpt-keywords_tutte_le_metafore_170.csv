0;ABILITY_TO_EVALUATE_GOVERNMENT_IS_ABILITY_TO_SEE;Seein;Citizen_evaluation_of_government;"vision;seen_object;seer";"evaluation;behavior;evaluator";"Government transparency enables the public to hold the government accountable for how they spend their money; Beijing has encouraged regional authorities to introduce sunshine policies that tackle corruption through increased transparency";"In the metaphor ABILITY_TO_EVALUATE_GOVERNMENT_IS_ABILITY_TO_SEE, the source frame is ""Seeing"" and the target frame is ""Citizen_evaluation_of_government"". The roles in the source frame, namely ""vision"", ""seen_object"", and ""seer"", correspond to ""evaluation"", ""behavior"", and ""evaluator"" in the target frame respectively.

The metaphorical connection between these roles is based on the conceptual ties between the act of seeing and the process of evaluating. The *vision* in the source frame corresponds to the *evaluation* in the target frame. This suggests that just as vision allows us to perceive and understand our surroundings, evaluation enables citizens to assess and comprehend the actions of the government.

The *seen_object* in the source frame corresponds to the *behavior* in the target frame. This implies that the actions or behavior of the government are like objects that can be seen, scrutinized, and evaluated by the citizens.

The *seer* in the source frame corresponds to the *evaluator* in the target frame. This indicates that the citizens, like seers, have the ability to observe and evaluate the government's actions.

This metaphor highlights the importance of *transparency* in governance. Just as clear vision is dependent on light and absence of obstructions, effective evaluation of government by citizens is dependent on the government's transparency. The examples provided refer to ""sunshine policies"" and ""government transparency"", reinforcing the metaphorical connection between seeing and evaluating.

The metaphor also implies a sense of *empowerment* for the citizens. Just as a seer has control over their gaze and what they choose to focus on, citizens have the power to evaluate and hold the government accountable.

Furthermore, the metaphor suggests a *responsibility* on the part of the citizens. Just as a seer must use their vision responsibly and accurately, citizens must use their ability to evaluate the government in a responsible and informed manner.

In essence, this metaphor encapsulates the dynamics of democratic governance, emphasizing *transparency*, *accountability*, *empowerment*, and *responsibility*.";"vision; evaluation; seen_object; behavior; seer; evaluator; transparency; empowerment; responsibility; transparency; accountability; empowerment; responsibility"
1;ABILITY_TO_EVALUATE_IS_ABILITY_TO_SEE;Seeing;Evaluation;"seer;seen_object;seen_object_perceived_elements";"evaluator;evaluee;basis_of_evaluation";His judgement is clouded;"In the metaphor ABILITY_TO_EVALUATE_IS_ABILITY_TO_SEE, the source frame is ""Seeing"" and the target frame is ""Evaluation"". The roles in the source frame are the 'seer', the 'seen object', and the 'seen object perceived elements', which correspond to the 'evaluator', the 'evaluee', and the 'basis of evaluation' in the target frame respectively.

The metaphorical connection between the roles in the source and target frames can be understood as follows:

1. The 'seer' in the source frame corresponds to the 'evaluator' in the target frame. This connection implies that the act of seeing is metaphorically linked to the act of evaluating. The *clarity* or *sharpness* of vision can be seen as the *accuracy* or *precision* of evaluation.

2. The 'seen object' in the source frame corresponds to the 'evaluee' in the target frame. This suggests that the object being seen is metaphorically the subject or entity being evaluated. The *visibility* or *distinctness* of the object can be seen as the *understanding* or *comprehension* of the subject being evaluated.

3. The 'seen object perceived elements' in the source frame corresponds to the 'basis of evaluation' in the target frame. This implies that the elements or details perceived in the seen object are metaphorically the criteria or standards used for evaluation. The *detail* or *completeness* of perception can be seen as the *thoroughness* or *comprehensiveness* of the evaluation.

The example ""His judgement is clouded"" illustrates this metaphor. Here, the clouded judgement metaphorically represents impaired vision, suggesting that the evaluator's ability to see clearly (evaluate accurately) is hindered, affecting the quality of the evaluation.

This metaphor also implies a dynamic process of *perception* and *interpretation*. Just as the seer perceives and interprets visual information, the evaluator perceives and interprets information about the evaluee. This process involves *discernment*, *analysis*, and *judgement*, which are crucial in both seeing and evaluating.

Furthermore, the metaphor suggests that just as vision can be influenced by external factors (like light, distance, or obstacles), evaluation can be influenced by various factors (like bias, lack of information, or external pressure). This highlights the concept of *subjectivity* and *context-dependency* in both seeing and evaluating.";"clarity; sharpness; accuracy; precision; visibility; distinctness; understanding; comprehension; detail; completeness; thoroughness; comprehensiveness; perception; interpretation; discernment; analysis; judgement; subjectivity; context-dependency"
2;ABILITY_TO_KNOW_IS_ABILITY_TO_SEE;Seeing;Knowing;"seen_object;seer";"knowledge;knower";"The US is blind to the limits of Palestinian politics; See-er's vision is impaired ;The issue was exposed to the light of day;The government covered up the high levels of radiation";"In the metaphor ABILITY_TO_KNOW_IS_ABILITY_TO_SEE, the source frame is Seeing and the target frame is Knowing. The metaphorical connections between the roles in the source frame (seen_object; seer) and those in the target frame (knowledge; knower) are as follows:

1. The *seen_object* in the source frame corresponds to *knowledge* in the target frame. This connection suggests that knowledge, like a seen object, is something that can be perceived, understood, and interpreted. It implies that knowledge is not just abstract and intangible, but can be 'seen' or 'visualized' in a certain way. This connection also implies that the clarity or obscurity of the 'seen object' can reflect the clarity or obscurity of the knowledge.

2. The *seer* in the source frame corresponds to the *knower* in the target frame. This connection suggests that the knower, like the seer, is an active participant who engages with the knowledge/seen object. It implies that the knower's ability to 'see' or understand the knowledge can be influenced by their perspective, focus, and perceptual abilities, just as a seer's vision can be influenced by these factors.

The metaphor ABILITY_TO_KNOW_IS_ABILITY_TO_SEE thus encapsulates several key concepts:

- *Perception & Interpretation*: Just as we perceive and interpret what we see, we also perceive and interpret knowledge. This process can be influenced by our perspective, focus, and perceptual abilities.

- *Clarity & Obscurity*: Just as objects can be clear or obscure to our vision, knowledge can also be clear or obscure to our understanding. This can depend on the complexity of the knowledge, our prior knowledge, and our cognitive abilities.

- *Active Engagement*: Just as seeing involves active engagement with the visual world, knowing involves active engagement with knowledge. This can involve seeking out knowledge, processing it, and integrating it into our existing knowledge structures.

- *Visibility & Exposure*: Just as light can expose objects to our vision, exposure can bring knowledge into our understanding. Conversely, just as objects can be hidden from our vision, knowledge can also be hidden or covered up. This can be due to deliberate concealment, lack of access, or our own cognitive limitations.";"seen_object; knowledge; seer; knower; Perception & Interpretation; Clarity & Obscurity; Active Engagement; Visibility & Exposure"
3;ACHIEVING_A_PURPOSE_IS_ACQUIRING_A_DESIRED_OBJECT;Gain_possession;Purposeful_action;"possession;getting_x-schema;recipient";"objective;action_x-schema;actor";"They just handed him the job; Seize the opportunity; I kept getting close to a world championship but it kept escaping me; He finally managed to get a smile out of her;She landed four huge accounts this year";"In the metaphor ACHIEVING_A_PURPOSE_IS_ACQUIRING_A_DESIRED_OBJECT, the source frame is Gain_possession and the target frame is Purposeful_action. The source roles are possession, getting_x-schema, and recipient, while the target roles are objective, action_x-schema, and actor.

The metaphorical connections between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame can be understood as follows:

1. *Possession* in the source frame is metaphorically linked to *Objective* in the target frame. This connection implies that the achievement of a purpose is viewed as acquiring or possessing a desired object. The objective or goal is seen as something tangible that can be possessed or owned.

2. *Getting_x-schema* in the source frame is metaphorically connected to *Action_x-schema* in the target frame. This suggests that the process of achieving a purpose is likened to the process of acquiring or getting something. The actions taken to achieve a purpose are compared to the actions taken to gain possession of an object.

3. *Recipient* in the source frame is metaphorically linked to *Actor* in the target frame. This implies that the person who achieves the purpose (actor) is seen as the recipient of the desired object. The actor is the one who receives the benefits or outcomes of the purposeful action.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the conceptual ties of *attainment* and *ownership*. Achieving a purpose is seen as a process of attaining or gaining something valuable, similar to acquiring a desired object. This process involves a sense of ownership, as the achieved purpose or goal is seen as something that belongs to the actor.

Furthermore, this metaphor also encompasses nuances such as *effort & struggle* (as seen in the examples ""I kept getting close to a world championship but it kept escaping me"" and ""He finally managed to get a smile out of her""), *opportunity & timing* (as in ""Seize the opportunity"" and ""They just handed him the job""), and *success & accomplishment* (as in ""She landed four huge accounts this year""). These nuances highlight the complexities and challenges involved in achieving a purpose, which are metaphorically compared to the difficulties and rewards of acquiring a desired object.";"Possession; Objective; Getting_x-schema; Action_x-schema; Recipient; Actor; attainment; ownership; effort & struggle; opportunity & timing; success & accomplishment"

The metaphorical connections between roles in the source frame and those in the target frame are as follows:

- The self-motion_x-schema in the source frame corresponds to the action_x-schema in the target frame. This connection implies that the *process* of moving towards a destination is metaphorically linked to the *process* of carrying out an action with a specific purpose.

- The self-mover in the source frame corresponds to the actor in the target frame. This suggests that the individual or entity that is moving towards a destination is metaphorically seen as the one who performs the purposeful action. This connection highlights the concept of *agency* and *responsibility*.

- The destination in the source frame corresponds to the purpose in the target frame. This implies that the end point of a journey is metaphorically seen as the goal or objective of a purposeful action. This connection emphasizes the concept of *goal-orientation* and *achievement*.

The examples provided illustrate these metaphorical connections. For instance, ""We've reached the end"" and ""We're where we wanted to go"" metaphorically express the achievement of a purpose as reaching a destination. ""The goal is a long way off"" and ""We only have short way to go"" metaphorically convey the progress or lack thereof towards achieving a purpose. ""He is just floating around"" metaphorically represents lack of purpose as lack of direction.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the conceptual ties between *physical movement* and *purposeful action*. Just as physical movement involves a starting point, a path, and a destination, purposeful action involves an initial state, a process, and a goal. The metaphor also encompasses nuances such as *progress & proximity*, *direction & guidance*, and *arrival paralleled with achievement*. The metaphor suggests that achieving a purpose, like reaching a destination, requires effort, direction, and perseverance. It also implies that lack of purpose, like lack of direction, results in aimless wandering or stagnation.";"process; process; agency; responsibility; goal-orientation; achievement; physical movement; purposeful action; progress & proximity; direction & guidance; arrival paralleled with achievement"
5;ACHIEVING_POWER_IS_MOVING_UPWARDS;Upward_motion;Power;mover;ower_holder;"Hitler's rise to power cannot be attributed to one event but a mixture of factors including events happening outside Germany; Regensburg's political influence reached its peak when Regensburg was city of the Perpetual Diet or General Assembly of the Imperial Estates of the Holy Roman Empire from 1663 to 1806";"In the metaphor ACHIEVING_POWER_IS_MOVING_UPWARDS, the source frame is Upward_motion and the target frame is Power. The source role is the mover, which corresponds to the target role of power_holder. This metaphorical connection is based on the conceptual link between the physical act of moving upwards and the abstract concept of gaining power.

The metaphor implies a *journey* or *progression* that involves overcoming obstacles or challenges, similar to the physical effort required to ascend. This is reflected in the example of Hitler's rise to power, which was not a result of a single event, but a complex interplay of various factors. The metaphor captures the idea that achieving power is not a simple or straightforward process, but rather a *struggle* or *climb* that requires effort, strategy, and resilience.

The metaphor also suggests a *hierarchical structure* in the power dynamics, where the higher one moves, the more power one holds. This is evident in the example of Regensburg's political influence peaking when it became the city of the Perpetual Diet or General Assembly of the Imperial Estates of the Holy Roman Empire. The city's 'upward movement' in the political hierarchy resulted in it achieving its highest level of power.

Furthermore, the metaphor implies a *directionality* in the pursuit of power, where moving upwards is associated with progress and success, while moving downwards is associated with failure or loss of power. This is a common theme in many cultures, where 'up' is often associated with positive outcomes and 'down' with negative ones.

In addition, the metaphor also suggests a sense of *visibility* and *exposure*. Just as someone moving upwards becomes more visible in a physical landscape, a person or entity gaining power becomes more noticeable and influential in a social or political landscape.

Finally, the metaphor also implies a sense of *transformation* and *change*. Just as a physical journey changes the position and perspective of the mover, the journey to power changes the status and influence of the power holder. This transformation is not just external, but also internal, affecting the power holder's identity, perception, and actions.";"journey; progression; struggle; climb; hierarchical structure; directionality; visibility; exposure; transformation; change"
6;ACQUIRING_IDEAS_IS_EATING;Eating;Thinking_about;"eater;digesting;food";"thinker;considering;ideas";"We pitched them the idea and they ate it right up ; He's been feeding her lies all these years ; This article is hard to digest";"The metaphor ACQUIRING_IDEAS_IS_EATING establishes a conceptual framework where the process of acquiring ideas is likened to the act of eating. The source frame, Eating, and the target frame, Thinking_about, are connected through this metaphorical mapping. The roles within these frames also have corresponding connections.

In the source frame, the 'eater' is the one who consumes the food. This role is metaphorically linked to the 'thinker' in the target frame, who 'consumes' or processes ideas. The act of eating, which involves taking in, chewing, and digesting food, is paralleled with the act of thinking, where ideas are taken in, reflected upon, and internalized. This highlights the concept of *transformation* and *internalization*.

The 'digesting' role in the source frame corresponds to the 'considering' role in the target frame. Just as food is broken down and absorbed during digestion, ideas are broken down, analyzed, and understood during consideration. This process can be challenging or easy, depending on the complexity of the idea or the 'quality of consumption'. For instance, a hard-to-digest article parallels a difficult-to-understand idea.

The 'food' in the source frame corresponds to 'ideas' in the target frame. Just as food provides nourishment to the body, ideas provide intellectual nourishment. However, the quality and nature of the food/ideas can vary. For example, 'feeding her lies' suggests the idea of providing false or harmful information, akin to feeding someone unhealthy or poisonous food.

The examples given further illustrate these connections. Phrases like 'ate it right up' and 'hard to digest' use language associated with eating to describe the process of engaging with ideas. This metaphor also encompasses nuances such as *saturation & fulfillment* (feeling satisfied after consuming a good idea), *preferences & taste* (preferring certain types of ideas over others), and *chewing paralleled with reflection* (taking time to process and understand an idea). 

In conclusion, the metaphor ACQUIRING_IDEAS_IS_EATING provides a rich and nuanced framework for understanding the complex process of engaging with, processing, and internalizing ideas.";"transformation; internalization; saturation & fulfillment; preferences & taste; chewing paralleled with reflection"
7;ACTION_IS_BEING_IN_A_LOCATION;Being_at_a_location;Action;"landmark;experiencer";"action_x-schema;actor";"The car is in motion; I'm going to leave; She's close to resigning";"In the metaphor ACTION_IS_BEING_IN_A_LOCATION, the source frame is Being_at_a_location and the target frame is Action. The source roles are landmark and experiencer, while the target roles are action_x-schema and actor. This metaphorical connection implies that an action is conceptualized as being in a certain location, and the actor is the one who experiences this location.

The metaphorical connection between the source role of 'landmark' and the target role of 'action_x-schema' suggests that the action is viewed as a location or a state of being. For instance, in the example 'The car is in motion', 'motion' is the action that is metaphorically represented as a location. The car, which is the 'actor', is in this location, i.e., it is performing the action.

Similarly, the connection between the source role of 'experiencer' and the target role of 'actor' implies that the one who experiences the location is the one who performs the action. For example, in 'I'm going to leave', 'I' is the actor who is going to perform the action of leaving, which is metaphorically represented as moving towards a location.

This metaphor involves several key concepts. The first is the concept of *movement*, which is inherent in the idea of being in a location. This movement can be physical, as in the case of the car being in motion, or metaphorical, as in the case of someone being close to resigning. Another key concept is *change of state*, which is implied by the action. When an actor performs an action, they move from one state to another, just as when they move from one location to another.

The metaphor also involves the concept of *proximity*. The closer the actor is to the location, the closer they are to performing the action. This is evident in the example 'She's close to resigning', where the proximity to the location (resigning) indicates the imminence of the action.

Finally, the metaphor involves the concept of *agency*. The actor is not just passively in a location, but actively moves towards it, as in 'I'm going to leave'. This suggests that the actor has control over their actions, just as they have control over their movements in a physical space. 

In summary, the metaphor ACTION_IS_BEING_IN_A_LOCATION involves a complex interplay of concepts related to movement, change of state, proximity, and agency. It allows us to conceptualize actions in terms of spatial locations, providing a rich and nuanced understanding of these actions.";"movement; change of state; proximity; agency"
8;ACTION_IS_MOTION;Motion;Action;"motion_x-schema;mover";"action_x-schema;actor";This computer program turns the power on and off;"In the metaphor ACTION_IS_MOTION, the source frame is Motion and the target frame is Action. The roles in the source frame are motion_x-schema and mover, while the roles in the target frame are action_x-schema and actor. 

The metaphorical connection between these roles is that the *mover* in the source frame is conceptually tied to the *actor* in the target frame. This implies that the entity initiating or causing the motion is metaphorically seen as the entity performing the action. In the example provided, the computer program is the *mover* that initiates the motion (turning the power on and off), and it is also the *actor* that performs the action (turning the power on and off). 

The *motion_x-schema* in the source frame is conceptually tied to the *action_x-schema* in the target frame. This suggests that the process or pattern of motion is metaphorically seen as the process or pattern of action. In the example, the motion of turning the power on and off is metaphorically seen as the action of turning the power on and off. 

This metaphor reveals the underlying dynamics of how we perceive and understand actions. Actions are often conceptualized as motions, with a clear direction, a starting point (on), and an ending point (off). This metaphorical mapping allows us to understand abstract actions in terms of more concrete experiences of motion. 

Moreover, the metaphor also implies a sense of *control* and *manipulation*. Just as a mover controls the direction and speed of motion, an actor controls the process and outcome of an action. In the example, the computer program has the control to manipulate the power, turning it on and off. 

Additionally, the metaphor suggests a sense of *causality*. Just as motion requires a mover to initiate it, action requires an actor to perform it. This causality is inherent in the metaphor, highlighting the role of the actor/mover as the cause of the action/motion. 

Finally, the metaphor also encompasses the concept of *transformation*. Just as motion involves a change in position or state, action involves a change in situation or condition. In the example, the action of the computer program transforms the state of the power from on to off and vice versa.";"mover; actor; mover; actor; motion_x-schema; action_x-schema; control; manipulation; causality; transformation"

The metaphorical connections between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame are as follows:

1. The *mover* in the source frame corresponds to the *actor* in the target frame. This connection is based on the idea that just as a mover initiates and carries out movement along a path, an actor initiates and carries out an action. 

2. The *goal_of_motion* in the source frame corresponds to the *action_purpose* in the target frame. This connection is based on the idea that just as the goal of motion is the destination or end point towards which the mover is moving, the purpose of an action is the desired outcome or end result that the actor is trying to achieve.

3. The *path_of_motion* in the source frame corresponds to the *action_means* in the target frame. This connection is based on the idea that just as the path of motion is the route or course that the mover takes to reach the goal, the means of an action is the method or process that the actor uses to achieve the purpose.

4. The *course_of_motion* in the source frame corresponds to the *action_self* in the target frame. This connection is based on the idea that just as the course of motion is the actual process of moving along the path, the action itself is the actual process of carrying out the action.

In the provided examples, the devastation from the hurricane and Congress' refusal to compromise are metaphorically depicted as forces that are moving the nation along a path towards economic ruin, which is the undesired end point or goal. This metaphorical depiction highlights the *dynamics* and *directionality* of the actions and their potential consequences, as well as the *urgency* and *inevitability* of the situation if no corrective actions are taken. 

Furthermore, the metaphor also implies the concept of *agency*, as the nation is portrayed as a passive entity that is being moved along a path by external forces, rather than as an active agent that is capable of changing its course. This could reflect a sense of *powerlessness* or *victimhood*, which adds an emotional dimension to the metaphor. 

Finally, the metaphor also suggests a *trajectory* or *progression* over time, as the nation is not just in a state of economic ruin, but is moving towards it. This adds a temporal dimension to the metaphor, and implies that the situation could potentially get worse if the motion continues unchecked.";"mover; actor; goal_of_motion; action_purpose; path_of_motion; action_means; course_of_motion; action_self; dynamics; directionality; urgency; inevitability; agency; powerlessness; victimhood; trajectory; progression"
10;ACTION_IS_SELF-PROPELLED_MOTION_ALONG_A_PATH;Self_propelled_motion;Action;"self-motion_x-schema;self-mover";"action_x-schema;actor";"He exercised to the point of exhaustion ; She squeezed her way to thinner thighs ; He drank himself out of the promotion ; He went on with what he was doing ; She went back to sleep ; She successfully navigated her way through the contract negotiations";"In the metaphor ACTION_IS_SELF-PROPELLED_MOTION_ALONG_A_PATH, the source frame is Self_propelled_motion and the target frame is Action. The source role is self-motion_x-schema;self-mover, and the target role is action_x-schema;actor. 

Conceptually, this metaphor draws a parallel between the physical act of moving oneself along a path and the abstract concept of performing an action. The self-mover in the source frame corresponds to the actor in the target frame. Both roles imply an entity that initiates and carries out an activity, whether it's physical movement or an abstract action.

The metaphorical connection is based on the idea that both self-propelled motion and action require *initiative* and *effort* from the individual. Just as a self-mover must exert energy to move along a path, an actor must apply effort to perform an action. This metaphor also implies a sense of *direction* or *purpose*, as both self-propelled motion and action are typically goal-oriented.

In the provided examples, phrases like ""He exercised to the point of exhaustion"" and ""She squeezed her way to thinner thighs"" illustrate this metaphor. The physical exertion and goal-oriented nature of exercise is used to represent the effort and purpose involved in action. Similarly, ""He drank himself out of the promotion"" uses the self-destructive act of excessive drinking to metaphorically represent a detrimental action that leads to a negative outcome.

The metaphor also encompasses the concept of *persistence* and *endurance*. In phrases like ""He went on with what he was doing"" and ""She went back to sleep"", the continuation of self-propelled motion is used to represent the persistence in carrying out an action, despite obstacles or distractions. 

Finally, the metaphor implies a sense of *navigation* or *strategic planning*. In the example ""She successfully navigated her way through the contract negotiations"", the act of navigating a path is used to represent the strategic planning and execution involved in successful action. 

In summary, the metaphor ACTION_IS_SELF-PROPELLED_MOTION_ALONG_A_PATH draws on the concepts of *initiative*, *effort*, *direction*, *persistence*, *endurance*, and *strategic planning* to create a rich, multi-faceted comparison between physical movement and abstract action.";"initiative; effort; direction; purpose; persistence; endurance; navigation; strategic planning; initiative; effort; direction; persistence; endurance; strategic planning"
11;ADDRESSING_CRIME_IS_CONTROLLING_AN_ANIMAL;Animal;Crime;animal;criminal;Law enforcement officers have often described these arrests as a way of reining in criminals whose other more serious activities present a danger to the public;"In the metaphor ADDRESSING_CRIME_IS_CONTROLLING_AN_ANIMAL, the source frame is Animal, and the target frame is Crime. The source role is the animal, and the target role is the criminal. The metaphorical connection between these roles lies in the conceptualization of *control* and *management*.

In the source frame, an animal is often seen as a wild, unpredictable entity that needs to be controlled or managed for safety and order. This control can be achieved through various means such as training, taming, or reining in. The animal's behavior, if left unchecked, can lead to chaos or danger. This concept of control and management is transferred to the target frame, Crime.

In the target frame, a criminal is seen as a threat to societal order and safety, much like a wild animal. The criminal's actions, if not controlled or managed, can lead to chaos and danger. Law enforcement officers, therefore, are tasked with the job of 'reining in' these criminals, much like one would rein in a wild animal.

The example provided, 'Law enforcement officers have often described these arrests as a way of reining in criminals whose other more serious activities present a danger to the public', illustrates this metaphorical connection. Here, the act of 'reining in' criminals is linguistically tied to the act of controlling an animal, highlighting the metaphorical connection between the two frames.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the concepts of *danger* and *control*. In both frames, there is a potential danger (the wild animal or the criminal) that needs to be controlled to ensure safety and order. This control is exerted by an external authority (the animal trainer or the law enforcement officer). The metaphor also implies a sense of *unpredictability* and *wildness* associated with both the animal and the criminal, further strengthening the metaphorical connection.

In addition, the metaphor also encompasses nuances such as *authority & power*, *discipline & order*, and *consequences of lack of control*. These concepts are inherent in both the process of controlling an animal and addressing crime, making the metaphor a powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of crime and its control.";"control; management; danger; control; unpredictability; wildness; authority & power; discipline & order; consequences of lack of control"

The metaphorical connections between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame are as follows:

1. Medical professionals in the source frame are metaphorically linked to policy makers in the target frame. Both are the *agents* who diagnose the problem and devise strategies to address it. Just as medical professionals diagnose diseases and prescribe treatment, policy makers identify the causes of poverty and formulate policies to alleviate it.

2. The disease in the source frame is metaphorically connected to poverty in the target frame. Both represent the *problem* that needs to be addressed. Just as a disease is a physical affliction that harms the body, poverty is a social affliction that harms individuals and societies.

3. Treatment strategies in the source frame are metaphorically linked to policies in the target frame. Both represent the *solutions* to the problem. Just as treatment strategies are designed to cure diseases, policies are designed to alleviate poverty.

4. The body in the source frame is metaphorically connected to the impoverished entity in the target frame. Both represent the *recipient* of the problem and the solution. Just as the body suffers from the disease and benefits from the treatment, the impoverished entity suffers from poverty and benefits from the policies.

The example ""Improving access to education is the only sure way to cure us of poverty"" illustrates these metaphorical connections. Here, ""improving access to education"" is the policy (treatment strategy), ""poverty"" is the problem (disease), ""us"" is the impoverished entity (body), and the implied policy makers are the ones who can implement the policy (medical professionals).

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the concepts of *diagnosis*, *treatment*, and *recovery*. Just as a disease is diagnosed, treated, and eventually recovered from, poverty is identified, addressed, and potentially alleviated. This metaphor also implies that, like treating an illness, addressing poverty requires expertise, strategic planning, and targeted intervention. It suggests that poverty, like a disease, is not an inherent or unchangeable condition, but something that can be cured. This metaphor also carries a sense of *urgency* and *necessity*, as treating an illness is often a matter of life and death, and so is addressing poverty for those who are affected by it.";"agents; problem; solutions; recipient; diagnosis; treatment; recovery; urgency; necessity"

The metaphorical connections between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame are as follows:

1. The *body* in the source frame corresponds to *society* in the target frame. This suggests that just as the body is a complex system that can be afflicted by diseases, society is a complex system that can be plagued by social problems. 

2. The *disease* in the source frame corresponds to the *social_problem* in the target frame. This implies that social problems are viewed as diseases that harm society, disrupting its normal functioning and causing distress to its members.

3. The *doctors* in the source frame correspond to *authorities* in the target frame. This suggests that authorities, like doctors, have the responsibility to diagnose and treat the problems that afflict society.

4. The *spread_of_disease* in the source frame corresponds to the *spread_of_problem* in the target frame. This implies that social problems, like diseases, can spread and affect larger sections of society if not addressed promptly and effectively.

5. The *medical_professionals* in the source frame correspond to *public_officials* in the target frame. This suggests that public officials, like medical professionals, play a crucial role in managing and resolving social problems.

6. The *cure* in the source frame corresponds to *solving_problem* in the target frame. This implies that solving social problems is akin to curing diseases, restoring health to the body, or in this case, harmony and wellbeing to society.

The example given, ""Debt Ceiling Deal: Wrong Diagnosis Leads to Wrong Treatment for What Ails the Economy"" further illustrates this metaphor. Here, the economy is metaphorically viewed as a patient suffering from a disease (the debt ceiling issue), and the authorities (government officials) are seen as doctors who have made a wrong diagnosis, leading to ineffective treatment.

This metaphor carries the underlying dynamics of *diagnosis* and *treatment*, *responsibility* and *expertise*, and *prevention* and *cure*. It suggests that addressing social problems requires a deep understanding of the issues, just as treating an illness requires a correct diagnosis. It also implies that authorities, like doctors, bear the responsibility of treating these problems with their expertise. Furthermore, it emphasizes the importance of prevention and timely intervention to prevent the spread of problems, just as in the case of diseases.";"body; society; disease; social_problem; doctors; authorities; spread_of_disease; spread_of_problem; medical_professionals; public_officials; cure; solving_problem; diagnosis; treatment; responsibility; expertise; prevention; cure"

This metaphorical connection is established through the roles in the source frame (War) and those in the target frame (Addressing social problems). 

In the source frame, the roles include civilians, enemy attack, battlefield, victory, war strategies, weapons, enemy conquest, generals, power of weapons, enemy combatants, and army. These roles are metaphorically linked to the roles in the target frame, which include honest citizens, social problem, society, solving problem, social programs, police weapons, spread of problem, authorities, power to solve problems, immoral citizens, and public officials.

The *civilians* in a war scenario are compared to *honest citizens* in the societal context. Just as civilians are the innocent parties affected by the war, honest citizens are those impacted by social problems. The *enemy attack* in war is likened to the *social problem* in society, both representing threats that need to be addressed. The *battlefield* is metaphorically linked to *society*, both being the arenas where the conflict or problem unfolds.

The *victory* in war corresponds to *solving the problem* in the societal context, both signifying the successful resolution of the conflict or issue. The *war strategies* are compared to *social programs*, both being the planned actions to address the problem or enemy. The *weapons* used in war are likened to *police weapons* or legal measures used to combat social problems.

The *enemy conquest* in war is metaphorically linked to the *spread of problem* in society, both indicating the escalation of the issue or conflict. The *generals* in war correspond to the *authorities* in society, both being the leaders who strategize and direct actions. The *power of weapons* in war is compared to the *power to solve problems* in society, both representing the capacity to address the issue or enemy. 

The *enemy combatants* in war are likened to *immoral citizens* in society, both being the sources of conflict or problems. Finally, the *army* in war is metaphorically linked to *public officials*, both being the forces that fight against the enemy or problem.

The examples provided, such as ""The most powerful weapon in the war against obesity might be something we all understand: cold hard cash"" and ""How America's losing the war on poverty"", further illustrate this metaphorical connection. They highlight the conceptual ties between the roles in the source and target frames, emphasizing the dynamics of *conflict*, *strategy*, *power*, and *resolution* that underlie both war and addressing social problems. 

In essence, this metaphor suggests that addressing social problems requires a similar level of strategy, effort, and determination as waging a war. It underscores the seriousness of social problems and the need for collective action, just as in a war scenario.";"civilians; honest citizens; enemy attack; social problem; battlefield; society; victory; solving the problem; war strategies; social programs; weapons; police weapons; enemy conquest; spread of problem; generals; authorities; power of weapons; power to solve problems; enemy combatants; immoral citizens; army; public officials; conflict; strategy; power; resolution"

The metaphorical connections between the roles in the source frame and the target frame are as follows:

1. The *dissector* in the source frame corresponds to the *analyzer* in the target frame. This connection implies that the person who is dissecting (breaking down into parts) an entity in the source frame is similar to the person who is analyzing (examining in detail) an object in the target frame. The underlying dynamic here is the *active role* that the individual takes in both scenarios, whether it's dissecting an entity or analyzing an object.

2. The *entity_in_pieces* in the source frame corresponds to the *analytic_conclusion* in the target frame. This connection suggests that the result of the dissection process, which leaves the entity in pieces, is similar to the outcome of the analysis process, which is the analytic conclusion. The underlying dynamic here is the *transformation* of the original entity or object through a detailed examination process.

3. The *dissected_entity* in the source frame corresponds to the *object_of_analysis* in the target frame. This connection implies that the entity being dissected is similar to the object being analyzed. The underlying dynamic here is the *focus* of the individual's attention and effort, whether it's on dissecting an entity or analyzing an object.

4. The *dissection_tool* in the source frame corresponds to the *analytic_method* in the target frame. This connection suggests that the tool used to dissect the entity is similar to the method used to analyze the object. The underlying dynamic here is the *means* by which the individual achieves their goal, whether it's through using a dissection tool or an analytic method.

The metaphor ANALYZING_IS_DISSECTING thus encapsulates the concepts of *active role*, *transformation*, *focus*, and *means*. In both dissecting and analyzing, there is an active process of breaking down or examining in detail, a transformation of the original entity or object, a focus of attention and effort, and a means to achieve the goal. These abstract processes can be compared to physical processes, but they also encompass nuances such as *precision & detail*, *methodical approach*, *critical thinking*, and *interpretation paralleled with understanding*.";"dissector; analyzer; active role; entity_in_pieces; analytic_conclusion; transformation; dissected_entity; object_of_analysis; focus; dissection_tool; analytic_method; means; active role; transformation; focus; means; precision & detail; methodical approach; critical thinking; interpretation paralleled with understanding"

The metaphorical connections between roles in the source frame and those in the target frame are as follows:

1. Cause_of_fire (source role) is metaphorically connected to cause_of_anger (target role). This signifies that just as a fire requires a spark or a source to ignite, anger too needs a trigger or a cause to arise. The phrase ""Those are inflammatory remarks"" is a linguistic manifestation of this connection, where inflammatory remarks are seen as the cause of anger, akin to a spark causing a fire.

2. Fire_intensity (source role) is linked to anger_level (target role). This suggests that the intensity of a fire is metaphorically similar to the level of anger. The phrase ""She was doing a slow burn"" exemplifies this connection, where a slow burn signifies simmering anger.

3. Burning_object (source role) is related to experiencer (target role). This implies that just as an object is consumed by fire, the person experiencing anger is metaphorically consumed by their emotion. ""He was consumed by his anger"" illustrates this connection.

4. Nearby_objects (source role) is connected to other_people (target role). This indicates that just as fire can affect nearby objects, a person's anger can impact other people around them. The phrase ""Your insincere apology just added fuel to the fire"" shows how other people's actions can intensify the anger, similar to adding fuel to a fire.

5. Fire (source role) is linked to anger (target role). This is the overarching metaphorical connection that anger is like fire.

6. Burning_object_condition (source role) is related to mind_condition (target role). This suggests that the state of the object being burned is metaphorically similar to the mental state of the person experiencing anger. ""After the argument Dave was smoldering for days"" exemplifies this connection, where smoldering signifies a lingering state of anger, akin to an object continuing to burn.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the concepts of *intensity*, *consumption*, and *spread*. Just as fire can vary in intensity, consume objects, and spread to nearby objects, anger can vary in intensity, consume the person experiencing it, and affect others. The metaphor also encompasses nuances such as *lingering effects* (smoldering anger), *escalation* (adding fuel to the fire), and *visual representation* (seeing red).";"intensity; consumption; spread; lingering effects; escalation; visual representation"
17;ANGER_IS_HEAT;Heat;Anger;"heat_x-schema;heat_level";"anger_x-schema;anger_level";"He has a hot temper; He's burning with rage";"In the metaphor ANGER_IS_HEAT, the source frame is Heat and the target frame is Anger. The roles in the source frame, represented by heat_x-schema and heat_level, are metaphorically connected to the roles in the target frame, represented by anger_x-schema and anger_level. 

The linguistic connection between these roles is evident in the phrases ""He has a hot temper"" and ""He's burning with rage"". In both examples, the words ""hot"" and ""burning"" are used to describe the intensity of anger, drawing a parallel between the physical sensation of heat and the emotional state of anger. 

Conceptually, this metaphor suggests that anger, like heat, is a *force* that can increase in intensity. Just as heat can be measured on a scale, so too can anger. This implies that anger, like heat, can be *controlled* and *regulated*. 

The metaphor also suggests a connection between the physical sensations associated with anger and the experience of heat. When people are angry, they often feel hot, their heart rate increases, and they may start to sweat. These physical reactions are similar to the body's response to heat, reinforcing the metaphorical connection between anger and heat.

Furthermore, the metaphor implies that anger, like heat, can be *dangerous* if not properly managed. Just as excessive heat can cause burns or start fires, excessive anger can lead to destructive behavior or damage relationships. 

Finally, the metaphor suggests that anger, like heat, can be *transient*. Just as heat dissipates over time, so too can anger. This implies that anger, like heat, is not a permanent state but rather a temporary reaction to a specific situation.

In summary, the metaphor ANGER_IS_HEAT draws both linguistic and conceptual connections between the roles in the source frame (Heat) and those in the target frame (Anger). It suggests that anger, like heat, is a force that can be measured, controlled, and regulated. It also implies that anger, like heat, can be dangerous if not properly managed and is transient in nature.";"force; controlled; regulated; dangerous; transient"

This metaphorical mapping is based on the shared characteristics of *loss of control*, *irrational behavior*, and *extreme emotional response* that are common to both insanity and anger. 

In the source frame, the role of the 'insane_person' corresponds to the 'experiencer' in the target frame. This connection highlights the individual who is undergoing the intense emotional state, whether it be anger or insanity. The 'insane_behavior' in the source frame is mirrored by 'angry_action' in the target frame, emphasizing the irrational and often uncontrollable actions that result from both states. 

The 'agitation_level' and 'agitation_limit' in the source frame map onto 'anger_level' and 'anger_limit' in the target frame, respectively. This connection underscores the escalating intensity of the emotional state, and the threshold beyond which the individual loses control, metaphorically crossing into the realm of insanity when they become excessively angry.

The 'cause_of_insanity' in the source frame corresponds to the 'cause_of_anger' in the target frame. This connection suggests that specific triggers or events can provoke both insanity and anger. 

Finally, the role of 'insanity' in the source frame is linked to 'anger' in the target frame, reinforcing the overall metaphorical concept that extreme anger is akin to insanity.

The examples provided further illustrate these metaphorical connections. Phrases such as ""he went crazy"", ""you're driving me nuts"", ""I'm mad"", ""foaming at the mouth"", ""get hysterical"", ""went out of his mind"", ""have a fit"", ""tearing his hair out"", and ""climbing the walls"" all depict anger in terms of insanity, emphasizing the *loss of control*, *irrational behavior*, and *extreme emotional response* that characterize both states.

In essence, the metaphor ANGER_IS_INSANITY encapsulates the idea that intense anger can lead to a state of mind and behavior that resembles insanity, highlighting the potential for *destructiveness*, *chaos*, and *disruption* that can result from uncontrolled anger. This metaphor also implies a *warning* about the dangers of unchecked anger, suggesting that it can lead to a metaphorical 'insanity' that is socially unacceptable and potentially harmful.";"loss of control; irrational behavior; extreme emotional response; loss of control; irrational behavior; extreme emotional response; destructiveness; chaos; disruption; warning"

The metaphorical connections between roles in the source frame and those in the target frame can be analyzed as follows:

1. *Container_top* in the source frame corresponds to *mind* in the target frame. This suggests that the mind is seen as a container that can be filled with anger, similar to how a container can be filled with a fluid. This connection implies a *limitation* or *capacity* concept, where the mind, like a container, has a certain capacity to hold anger.

2. *Container_pressure_limit* corresponds to *anger_limit*. This connection implies that there is a certain limit to how much anger one can hold before it becomes too much, similar to how a container has a pressure limit before it can no longer contain the fluid.

3. *Container_heat* and *fluid_heat_level* correspond to *body_heat* and *anger_level* respectively. This suggests that as the heat in the container or fluid increases, so does the level of anger. This connection implies the concept of *intensity* or *escalation*.

4. *Fluid* and *fluid_agitation* correspond to *anger* and *body_agitation*. This suggests that anger is seen as a fluid that can be agitated, similar to how a fluid in a container can be agitated. This connection implies the concept of *disturbance* or *disruption*.

5. *Container* corresponds to *body*. This suggests that the body is seen as a container for anger, similar to how a container holds fluid. This connection implies the concept of *containment*.

6. *Container_internal_pressure* corresponds to *body_pressure*. This suggests that as the internal pressure in the container increases, so does the pressure in the body. This connection implies the concept of *stress* or *tension*.

The examples ""You make my blood boil"" and ""I had reached the boiling point"" further illustrate these connections. The phrase ""blood boil"" metaphorically represents the escalation of anger (heat of fluid), and ""reached the boiling point"" represents the limit of anger (container's pressure limit). 

This metaphor highlights the *dynamics* and *intensity* of anger, comparing it to the physical process of heating a fluid in a container. It encompasses nuances such as *pressure buildup & release*, *limits & overflow*, and *agitation paralleled with emotional disturbance*.";"Container_top; mind; limitation; capacity; Container_pressure_limit; anger_limit; Container_heat; fluid_heat_level; body_heat; anger_level; intensity; escalation; Fluid; fluid_agitation; anger; body_agitation; disturbance; disruption; Container; body; containment; Container_internal_pressure; body_pressure; stress; tension; dynamics; intensity; pressure buildup & release; limits & overflow; agitation paralleled with emotional disturbance"

This metaphorical connection allows for a more intuitive understanding of mathematical concepts, especially for those who are visual or hands-on learners.

The source frame, Object_Construction, involves roles such as objects, taking_apart, object_whole, bigger, putting_together, construction_act, smaller, smallest_object, object_size, and constructed_object. These roles are metaphorically mapped onto the target frame, Arithmetic, with corresponding roles: numbers, subtraction, number_whole, greater, addition, arithmetic_operation, less, one, number_size, and arithmetic_operation_result.

The metaphorical connections between these roles can be analyzed as follows:

- *Objects* in the source frame correspond to *numbers* in the target frame. Just as objects are the basic units in construction, numbers are the basic units in arithmetic.

- The act of *taking_apart* objects aligns with the arithmetic operation of *subtraction*. This connection highlights the conceptual link between deconstructing an object into smaller parts and subtracting numbers to yield a smaller result.

- The *object_whole* corresponds to the *number_whole*. This suggests the idea that numbers, like objects, can be seen as wholes that are composed of smaller parts.

- The terms *bigger* and *greater* are directly comparable, representing the concept of *increased size or quantity* in both frames.

- *Putting_together* objects is metaphorically linked to the operation of *addition*. This connection underscores the idea that adding numbers is akin to constructing a larger object from smaller parts.

- The *construction_act* is paralleled with *arithmetic_operation*. This implies that performing arithmetic is like engaging in a process of construction.

- The terms *smaller* and *less* are directly comparable, representing the concept of *decreased size or quantity* in both frames.

- The *smallest_object* corresponds to the number *one*, suggesting the idea of a basic, indivisible unit in both frames.

- *Object_size* is linked to *number_size*, indicating that the size of an object can be represented numerically.

- The *constructed_object* corresponds to the *arithmetic_operation_result*. This connection implies that the result of an arithmetic operation is like a newly constructed object.

The examples provided further illustrate these metaphorical connections. For instance, ""Five is made up of two plus three"" and ""If you put 2 and 2 together you get 4"" both express the idea of *addition as construction*, where numbers are put together to create a larger whole.

This metaphorical framework not only aids in understanding arithmetic but also highlights the underlying dynamics of *transformation*, *composition*, and *decomposition*. Just as objects can be assembled and disassembled, numbers can be added and subtracted. This metaphor also encompasses nuances such as *scale & proportion*, *unity & divisibility*, and *construction paralleled with calculation*.";"Objects; numbers; taking_apart; subtraction; object_whole; number_whole; bigger; greater; increased size or quantity; Putting_together; addition; construction_act; arithmetic_operation; smaller; less; decreased size or quantity; smallest_object; one; Object_size; number_size; constructed_object; arithmetic_operation_result; addition as construction; transformation; composition; decomposition; scale & proportion; unity & divisibility; construction paralleled with calculation"

The metaphorical connection between these two frames is the concept of *acquisition* and *ownership*. In the source frame, the roles of possession, recipient, and getting_x-schema.finish are paralleled in the target frame by ability_to_control, controlling_entity, and control_relation_status.start. 

The linguistic ties between these roles can be seen in the use of words and phrases that denote acquisition and control. For example, in the phrase ""the government got control of a couple of the auto companies"", the word ""got"" is used to denote the acquisition (gaining possession) and ""control"" denotes the ability to direct or influence (control). Similarly, in the book title ""The Shadow Party: How George Soros Hillary Clinton and Sixties Radicals Seized Control of the Democratic Party"", the word ""seized"" denotes a forceful acquisition (gaining possession) and ""control"" again denotes the ability to direct or influence (control).

Conceptually, the metaphor draws a parallel between the physical act of gaining possession of an object and the abstract act of attaining control over something. Just as one gains possession of an object and becomes the owner with the ability to use or dispose of the object as they wish, one who attains control becomes the controlling entity with the ability to direct or influence the course of the controlled entity. 

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the concepts of *power* and *authority*. In both gaining possession and attaining control, there is a transfer of power from one entity to another. The entity that gains possession or attains control now has the authority to determine the fate of the possessed or controlled entity. This metaphor also encompasses nuances such as *struggle for control*, *dominance*, and *influence*. 

In the examples provided, the government and the radicals are portrayed as entities that have gained possession (attained control) and thus have the power and authority to determine the fate of the auto companies and the Democratic Party respectively. This metaphor thus serves to highlight the dynamics of power and control in these contexts.";"acquisition; ownership; power; authority; struggle for control; dominance; influence"
22;ATTRIBUTES_ARE_ENTITIES;Entity;Attribute;entity;attribute;If you soak it in water the wood will lose its rigidity;"In the metaphor ATTRIBUTES_ARE_ENTITIES, the source frame is an 'Entity' and the target frame is an 'Attribute'. The source role is an 'entity' and the target role is an 'attribute'. The example given is 'If you soak it in water the wood will lose its rigidity'. 

The metaphorical connection between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame is that the 'entity' (wood) is being used to represent the 'attribute' (rigidity). This is a conceptual tie, as the physical properties of the wood (its rigidity) are being used to represent an abstract concept (the attribute of rigidity). 

The linguistic tie is the use of the verb 'lose', which is typically used to describe the loss of a physical entity, but in this case is being used to describe the loss of an attribute. This creates a metaphorical connection between the physical act of losing an entity and the abstract concept of losing an attribute.

Diving deeper into the metaphor, we can extract the concept of *transformation*. Just as wood loses its rigidity when soaked in water, an attribute can be lost or changed under certain conditions. This metaphor also implies the concept of *vulnerability*, as the wood's rigidity is not inherent or permanent, but can be lost. 

Another key concept is *conditionality*. The wood's rigidity is conditional on it not being soaked in water, just as an attribute might be conditional on certain circumstances. 

Finally, the metaphor suggests the concept of *interdependence* between entities and their attributes. The wood's identity is tied to its rigidity, just as an entity might be defined by its attributes. 

Overall, the metaphor ATTRIBUTES_ARE_ENTITIES uses the physical properties of an entity to represent the abstract concept of an attribute, drawing on concepts of transformation, vulnerability, conditionality, and interdependence.";"transformation; vulnerability; conditionality; interdependence"
23;ATTRIBUTES_ARE_POSSESSIONS;Possession;Attribute;"posessor;possession";"entity;attribute";"She has a sunny disposition; This place has lost a lot of its charm; The new mustache gave him an older appearance";"In the metaphor ATTRIBUTES_ARE_POSSESSIONS, the source frame is Possession and the target frame is Attribute. The roles in the source frame are 'possessor' and 'possession', and these correspond to 'entity' and 'attribute' in the target frame, respectively. 

The metaphorical connection between these roles is that attributes, which are intangible qualities or characteristics, are conceptualized as possessions, which are tangible items that one owns or controls. This metaphor allows us to understand abstract concepts (attributes) in terms of more concrete, familiar experiences (possessions).

In the example ""She has a sunny disposition"", the woman (entity) is the possessor and the sunny disposition (attribute) is the possession. This metaphorical mapping allows us to understand the woman's disposition as something she owns or controls, similar to a physical object. 

Similarly, in the example ""This place has lost a lot of its charm"", the place (entity) is the possessor and the charm (attribute) is the possession. The metaphor suggests that the place once 'owned' or 'had' charm, but it has now 'lost' it, as one might lose a physical object.

In the third example, ""The new mustache gave him an older appearance"", the man (entity) is the possessor and the older appearance (attribute) is the possession. The mustache is seen as 'giving' him this possession, much like one might give a physical gift.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the conceptualization of intangible attributes as tangible possessions. This involves the key concepts of *ownership* and *control*. Just as we own and control our possessions, we are seen as owning and controlling our attributes. This metaphor also involves the concept of *transformation*, as attributes can be 'gained', 'lost', or 'given', just like possessions. 

Moreover, the metaphor encompasses nuances such as *value & worth* (some attributes/possessions are more desirable than others), *transience & permanence* (attributes/possessions can be temporary or lasting), and *visibility & invisibility* (attributes, unlike possessions, are not always immediately visible).";"ownership; control; transformation; value & worth; transience & permanence; visibility & invisibility"
24;BEING_GOOD_IS_BEING_UPRIGHT;Upright_posture;Moral_goodness;"upright_position;upright_person";"goodness;good_person";He is an upstanding citizen;"In the metaphor BEING_GOOD_IS_BEING_UPRIGHT, the source frame is Upright_posture and the target frame is Moral_goodness. The source role is an upright_position or an upright_person, and the target role is goodness or a good_person. The example given is ""He is an upstanding citizen.""

The metaphorical connection between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame is primarily based on the conceptual and linguistic association between physical uprightness and moral goodness. 

Conceptually, *uprightness* in physical terms is often associated with strength, balance, and stability. These are qualities that are often admired and seen as positive. When this concept is transferred to the moral domain, it suggests a person who is morally strong, balanced, and stable - in other words, a *good person*. 

Linguistically, the term ""upright"" is often used to describe someone who is honest, fair, and righteous. This is a direct transfer from the physical to the moral domain, where the upright position of the body is metaphorically linked to the upright character of a person. 

The example ""He is an upstanding citizen"" illustrates this metaphorical connection. The term ""upstanding"" is a linguistic manifestation of the metaphor, denoting a person who is morally upright or good. 

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the *transference* of qualities from the physical to the moral domain. This is a common feature of metaphors, where concrete, tangible concepts are used to understand and describe abstract, intangible ones. 

In this case, the physical act of standing upright is used to represent and understand the abstract concept of being morally good. This involves a process of *mapping* from the source domain (physical uprightness) to the target domain (moral goodness). 

This metaphor also implies a sense of *visibility* and *transparency*. Just as an upright posture is easily observable, an upright or good person is someone whose moral qualities are clear and evident to others. This suggests a connection between physical uprightness and moral transparency, adding another layer to the metaphor. 

Finally, the metaphor also encompasses nuances such as *consistency* and *steadfastness*. Just as maintaining an upright posture requires consistency and steadfastness, being a good person involves consistently adhering to moral principles and remaining steadfast in the face of moral challenges.";"uprightness; good person; transference; mapping; visibility; transparency; consistency; steadfastness"
25;BEING_IMMORAL_IS_BEING_LOW;Verticality;Morality;person_in_low_position;immoral_person;I refuse to stoop to that kind of behavior;"In the metaphor BEING_IMMORAL_IS_BEING_LOW, the source frame is Verticality, and the target frame is Morality. The source role is a person in a low position, and the target role is an immoral person. The example given is ""I refuse to stoop to that kind of behavior.""

The metaphorical connection between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame is based on the conceptual mapping of *vertical position* onto *moral standing*. This metaphor is rooted in our physical and social experiences, where being 'up' is often associated with power, status, and goodness, while being 'down' is linked with weakness, low status, and badness. 

In this metaphor, the *low position* in the source frame is conceptually linked to *immorality* in the target frame. This connection implies that immoral actions or behaviors are considered 'low' or beneath one's dignity. The act of 'stooping' in the example sentence further strengthens this connection, as it physically represents lowering oneself, which metaphorically signifies lowering one's moral standards.

The metaphor also implies a *hierarchical structure* in morality, where some actions are considered 'higher' (more moral) and others 'lower' (less moral). This hierarchy is conceptually tied to the verticality frame, where a person's position can be 'high' or 'low'. 

The metaphor also suggests a *choice or decision* to maintain one's moral standing. In the example, the speaker 'refuses to stoop', indicating a conscious decision not to engage in immoral behavior. This decision can be seen as a form of *self-regulation* or *self-control*, further linking the metaphor to concepts of personal integrity and moral responsibility.

In summary, the metaphor BEING_IMMORAL_IS_BEING_LOW connects the roles of a person in a low position (source frame) and an immoral person (target frame) through the concepts of *vertical position*, *moral hierarchy*, *choice or decision*, and *self-regulation*.";"vertical position; moral standing; low position; immorality; hierarchical structure; choice or decision; self-regulation; self-control; vertical position; moral hierarchy; choice or decision; self-regulation"
26;BELIEFS_ARE_POSSESSIONS;Possession;Belief;"possession_relation;possession;possessor;possess_relation_status";"belief_relation;belief;believer;belief_relation_status";Hold on to your beliefs and never let them go;"In the metaphor BELIEFS_ARE_POSSESSIONS, the source frame is Possession and the target frame is Belief. The roles in the source frame are possession_relation, possession, possessor, and possess_relation_status, while the roles in the target frame are belief_relation, belief, believer, and belief_relation_status. 

The metaphorical connections between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame are as follows:

1. *Possession_relation* in the source frame corresponds to *belief_relation* in the target frame. This implies that the way we relate to our possessions is metaphorically similar to how we relate to our beliefs. Just as we own, control, and manage our possessions, we also 'own', control, and manage our beliefs. 

2. *Possession* in the source frame corresponds to *belief* in the target frame. This suggests that beliefs are viewed as possessions that one can acquire, hold, and potentially lose. This connection highlights the *value* and *personal attachment* we place on our beliefs, similar to our possessions.

3. *Possessor* in the source frame corresponds to *believer* in the target frame. This indicates that the individual who holds the belief is seen as the 'owner' of that belief, similar to how a person owns a possession. This connection underscores the *personal responsibility* and *agency* we have over our beliefs.

4. *Possess_relation_status* in the source frame corresponds to *belief_relation_status* in the target frame. This suggests that the status of our relationship with our possessions (e.g., whether we still own them, have lost them, etc.) is metaphorically similar to the status of our relationship with our beliefs (e.g., whether we still hold them, have abandoned them, etc.). This connection emphasizes the *dynamic nature* of our beliefs, which can change over time just like our possessions.

The example ""Hold on to your beliefs and never let them go"" illustrates these connections. Just as we hold on to valuable possessions and do not easily let them go, we are encouraged to hold on to our beliefs and not easily abandon them. This highlights the *endurance* and *steadfastness* that are often associated with strong beliefs, as well as the *effort* and *determination* required to maintain them, similar to valuable possessions. 

In sum, the metaphor BELIEFS_ARE_POSSESSIONS conceptualizes beliefs as possessions that we own, value, and manage. This metaphor not only captures the personal attachment and responsibility we have towards our beliefs, but also the dynamic nature of our beliefs, which can change over time just like our possessions.";"Possession_relation; belief_relation; Possession; belief; value; personal attachment; Possessor; believer; personal responsibility; agency; Possess_relation_status; belief_relation_status; dynamic nature; endurance; steadfastness; effort; determination"

The metaphorical connections between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame are as follows:

1. The source role of 'fluid_level' corresponds to the target role of 'emotion_level'. This connection suggests that emotions, like fluid levels, can rise and fall, indicating the intensity or degree of the emotion. This connection also implies that emotions can be measured or quantified, similar to how we can measure the level of a fluid in a container.

2. The source role of 'fluid' corresponds to the target role of 'emotion'. This connection implies that emotions, like fluids, can flow, be contained, and can overflow if the level becomes too high. This connection also suggests that emotions can be 'poured out' or 'drained', similar to how fluids can be poured out of a container or drained.

3. The source role of 'container' corresponds to the target role of 'body'. This connection suggests that the body, like a container, holds emotions. This connection also implies that the body has a capacity for emotions, similar to how a container has a capacity for fluids.

4. The source role of 'container_capacity' corresponds to the target role of 'emotion_limit'. This connection suggests that there is a limit to the amount of emotion a body can hold, similar to how there is a limit to the amount of fluid a container can hold. This connection also implies that exceeding this limit can result in an overflow of emotions, similar to how exceeding the capacity of a container can result in an overflow of fluid.

The metaphor BODY_IS_A_CONTAINER_FOR_EMOTIONS highlights the conceptual ties between the physical experience of containing fluids and the abstract experience of feeling emotions. It suggests that emotions, like fluids, are something we carry within us, that they can be measured, and that there is a limit to how much we can hold. This metaphor also implies that emotions can be released or 'poured out', and that doing so can relieve the pressure of holding too much, similar to how releasing fluid from a container can prevent it from overflowing. This metaphor thus encapsulates the concepts of *containment*, *measurement*, *capacity*, and *release*.";"containment; measurement; capacity; release"
28;CAUSATION_IS_OBJECT_TRANSFER;Transfer_scenario;Causation;"transferor;transferred_object;transfer_recipient";"agent;effect;affected";The noise is giving me a headache;"In the metaphor CAUSATION_IS_OBJECT_TRANSFER, the source frame is a Transfer_scenario and the target frame is Causation. The roles in the source frame are transferor, transferred_object, and transfer_recipient, while the roles in the target frame are agent, effect, and affected. 

Conceptually, the metaphor draws a parallel between the act of transferring an object from one entity to another and the process of one event causing another. The *transferor* in the source frame corresponds to the *agent* in the target frame, suggesting that the entity initiating the transfer is also the one causing the effect. In the given example, ""The noise"" is the transferor and also the agent causing the effect.

The *transferred_object* in the source frame corresponds to the *effect* in the target frame. This implies that the object being transferred is metaphorically the result or consequence of the causation. In the example, ""a headache"" is the transferred object and also the effect of the noise.

The *transfer_recipient* in the source frame corresponds to the *affected* in the target frame, indicating that the entity receiving the object is the one affected by the causation. In the example, ""me"" is the transfer recipient and also the one affected by the noise.

Linguistically, the verb ""is giving"" in the example serves as a bridge between the source and target frames, embodying both the act of transferring an object and the process of causation. 

This metaphor also reveals deeper dynamics and implicit concepts such as *responsibility* and *impact*. The transferor or agent is seen as responsible for the transfer or causation, and the transferred object or effect represents the impact of this action on the transfer recipient or affected party. This metaphor can be used to highlight the direct and tangible consequences of certain actions or events, making abstract causation more concrete and understandable.";"transferor; agent; transferred_object; effect; transfer_recipient; affected; responsibility; impact"
29;CAUSED_CHANGE_OF_STATE_IS_CAUSED_CHANGE_OF_LOCATION;Forced_motion;Caused_change_of_state;"forceful_action;motion;agent;mover";"cause;state_change;agent;affected";"She was forced into an arranged marriage; Her parents kept pushing her until she succeeded";"In the metaphor CAUSED_CHANGE_OF_STATE_IS_CAUSED_CHANGE_OF_STATE, the source frame is Forced_motion and the target frame is Caused_change_of_state. The roles in the source frame are forceful_action, motion, agent, and mover, while the roles in the target frame are cause, state_change, agent, and affected.

The metaphorical connections between the roles in the source and target frames can be identified as follows:

1. *Forceful_action* in the source frame corresponds to *cause* in the target frame. This connection implies that the exertion of force or pressure (physical or metaphorical) can lead to a change in state. For example, in the provided examples, the parents' persistent pushing (forceful action) leads to their daughter's success (change of state).

2. *Motion* in the source frame is linked to *state_change* in the target frame. This suggests that the act of moving or being moved can be metaphorically seen as a transition from one state to another. In the examples, the forced motion into an arranged marriage represents a significant change in the woman's life state.

3. The *agent* in the source frame, the one who initiates the forceful action or motion, corresponds to the *agent* in the target frame, the one who causes the change of state. This highlights the role of an external entity in instigating change.

4. The *mover* in the source frame is connected to the *affected* in the target frame. This implies that the one who is moved or forced to move is the one who undergoes the change of state. In the examples, the woman is the one who is forced into motion (arranged marriage, pushed to succeed) and thus experiences the change of state.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the concept of *force* and *change*. The forceful action or motion instigated by an agent leads to a change in state for the affected party. This metaphor also encompasses nuances such as *resistance & compliance*, *direction & destination*, and *pressure paralleled with motivation*. The metaphor suggests that forceful actions, even if resisted, can lead to significant changes, and that the direction of the forced motion can determine the nature of the state change. Furthermore, the metaphor implies that pressure can serve as a form of motivation leading to change.";"Forceful_action; cause; Motion; state_change; agent; agent; mover; affected; force; change; resistance & compliance; direction & destination; pressure paralleled with motivation"
30;CAUSING_ECONOMIC_HARDSHIP_IS_CAUSING_PHYSICAL_HARM;Harm_to_living_entity;Economic_difficulty;"agent;physical_harm;victim";"cause_of_difficulty;difficulty;actor";Another round of cuts will cripple the economy;"In the metaphor CAUSING_ECONOMIC_HARDSHIP_IS_CAUSING_PHYSICAL_HARM, the source frame is ""Harm_to_living_entity"" and the target frame is ""Economic_difficulty"". The roles in the source frame are the agent, physical harm, and the victim, while the roles in the target frame are the cause of difficulty, difficulty, and the actor. 

The metaphorical connections between these roles can be understood as follows:

1. The *agent* in the source frame corresponds to the *cause of difficulty* in the target frame. This is the entity or action that initiates the harm or difficulty. In the given example, ""Another round of cuts"" is the agent that causes the economic hardship.

2. The *physical harm* in the source frame corresponds to the *difficulty* in the target frame. This is the negative outcome or impact caused by the agent. In the example, the economic hardship is the difficulty that is metaphorically equated to physical harm.

3. The *victim* in the source frame corresponds to the *actor* in the target frame. This is the entity that suffers or experiences the harm or difficulty. In the example, ""the economy"" is the actor that experiences the economic hardship.

Conceptually, this metaphor is based on the idea that economic hardship can be as damaging and painful as physical harm. This is a powerful metaphor because it highlights the severity and impact of economic difficulties, making them more tangible and relatable. 

The metaphor also implies a sense of *responsibility* and *consequence*. Just as causing physical harm to a living entity is generally seen as a serious wrongdoing, causing economic hardship is also viewed negatively. This metaphor thus emphasizes the responsibility of the agent (or cause of difficulty) and the serious consequences of their actions.

Furthermore, the metaphor suggests a process of *transformation* and *degradation*. Just as physical harm can lead to a decline in health, economic hardship can lead to a decline in economic health or prosperity. This metaphor thus captures the dynamics of decline and degradation in both physical and economic contexts.

Finally, the metaphor implies a sense of *vulnerability* and *suffering*. Just as a victim of physical harm suffers pain and distress, an actor experiencing economic difficulty also suffers. This metaphor thus highlights the suffering and vulnerability associated with economic hardship.";"agent; cause of difficulty; physical harm; difficulty; victim; actor; responsibility; consequence; transformation; degradation; vulnerability; suffering"

The metaphorical connection between these frames is that a change in control is conceptualized as a transfer of possession. 

In the source frame, the roles are the recipient, donor, and transferred_possession. In the target frame, these roles correspond to the controlling_entity, the entity losing control, and the ability_to_control, respectively. 

The recipient in the source frame is the entity that receives the transferred possession. This corresponds to the controlling_entity in the target frame, which is the entity that gains control. For example, in the sentence ""The US handed over control of the prisoners to Afghan authorities"", the Afghan authorities are the recipient of the transferred possession (control of the prisoners), making them the controlling_entity.

The donor in the source frame is the entity that gives away the possession. This corresponds to the entity losing control in the target frame. For example, in the sentence ""The Democrats wrested control of four governorships from the Republicans"", the Republicans are the donor of the transferred possession (control of the governorships), making them the entity losing control.

The transferred_possession in the source frame is the possession that is being transferred from the donor to the recipient. This corresponds to the ability_to_control in the target frame, which is what is gained or lost in the change of control. For example, in the sentence ""The government acquired control of the company's assets"", the control of the company's assets is the transferred_possession, making it the ability_to_control.

Conceptually, this metaphor highlights the dynamics of power and authority. Just as possessions can be given, taken, or lost, so can control. This metaphor also implies a *zero-sum game* where control is a finite resource that one entity's gain is another's loss. It also implies a *transactional nature* of control, similar to the exchange of physical possessions. 

Linguistically, verbs associated with transfer such as ""handed over"", ""wrested"", and ""acquired"" are used to describe changes in control, reinforcing the metaphorical connection. 

In terms of underlying dynamics, this metaphor suggests that control, like possession, can be *volatile* and *contingent*, subject to change based on various factors. It also implies that control, once transferred, changes the *status* and *power dynamics* between entities, similar to how ownership of a possession can change one's status and relationships with others.";"zero-sum game; transactional nature; volatile; contingent; status; power dynamics"
32;CHANGE_IS_ACQUISITION;Gain_possession;Change_of_state;"possession;recipient";"final_state;experiencer";I got a headache;"In the given data, the metaphor is CHANGE_IS_ACQUISITION. The source frame is Gain_possession, and the target frame is Change_of_state. The source roles are possession and recipient, while the target roles are final_state and experiencer. The example provided is ""I got a headache.""

The metaphorical connection between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame is that the process of *acquiring* something (a possession) is likened to the process of *experiencing* a change (a final state). In the source frame, the recipient gains possession of something, which is metaphorically linked to the experiencer in the target frame, who undergoes a change of state.

Conceptually, this metaphor suggests that changes are not merely things that happen to us passively, but rather things that we actively *acquire*, much like possessions. This implies a degree of *agency* and *control* over the changes we experience, as well as a sense of *ownership* over them. It also suggests that changes, like possessions, can be *tangible* and *concrete*, even if they are not physically so.

Linguistically, the verb ""got"" in the example ""I got a headache"" serves to bridge the source and target frames. It is a verb commonly used to denote acquisition (as in ""I got a new car""), but here it is used to denote a change of state (from not having a headache to having one). This linguistic tie reinforces the conceptual link between acquisition and change.

Furthermore, the metaphor also implies a process of *transformation* - from not having a possession to having one, and from one state to another. This transformation is not merely a change in status, but a change in the experiencer's condition or situation. It also implies a sense of *inevitability* or *irreversibility* - once you have acquired a possession or experienced a change, you cannot 'un-acquire' or 'un-experience' it.

This metaphor also encompasses nuances such as *value & worth* (as possessions are often valued), *desire & need* (as we often acquire things we want or need), and *effort & struggle* (as acquisition often requires effort). These nuances add depth to the metaphor, making it a rich and complex way of conceptualizing change.";"acquiring; experiencing; acquire; agency; control; ownership; tangible; concrete; transformation; inevitability; irreversibility; value & worth; desire & need; effort & struggle"
33;CHANGE_IS_LOSS;Lose_possession;Change_of_state;"possession;donor";"initial_state;experiencer";"My headache went away ; He lost his faith; He got rid of his headache";"In the metaphor CHANGE_IS_LOSS, the source frame is ""Lose_possession"" and the target frame is ""Change_of_state"". The source role is ""possession;donor"" and the target role is ""initial_state;experiencer"". 

Conceptually, this metaphor equates the process of change with the experience of loss. It suggests that when something changes, it is as if something has been lost. This metaphorical connection is based on the idea that change often involves leaving behind or losing an old state, condition, or way of being. This is a common way of conceptualizing change, as it captures the often difficult and painful process of letting go of the familiar and moving into the unknown.

Linguistically, the source role of ""possession;donor"" is linked to the target role of ""initial_state;experiencer"". The ""possession"" in the source frame refers to something that is owned or controlled by the ""donor"". In the target frame, the ""initial_state"" is the original condition or state of the ""experiencer"". The ""donor"" in the source frame is metaphorically connected to the ""experiencer"" in the target frame, as both are the subjects of the action (losing or changing).

The examples provided further illustrate these connections. ""My headache went away"" and ""He got rid of his headache"" both involve a change of state (from having a headache to not having a headache) that is conceptualized as a loss (the headache is gone or has been gotten rid of). ""He lost his faith"" also involves a change of state (from having faith to not having faith) that is conceptualized as a loss.

In this metaphor, the key concepts are *transformation* and *loss*. Just as a physical object can be lost, leaving the owner without it, a state or condition can change, leaving the experiencer in a new and different state. This metaphor also encompasses nuances such as *the pain or difficulty of loss*, *the uncertainty of change*, and *the potential for growth or improvement through change*.";"transformation; loss; the pain or difficulty of loss; the uncertainty of change; the potential for growth or improvement through change"

This metaphor is built on the fundamental human experience of motion and location change, and it uses this concrete experience to understand and express the more abstract concept of change in state.

In the source frame, ""Motion_along_a_path"", the roles include the landmark, goal, motion_x-schema, path, mover, and source. These roles correspond to the target frame, ""Change_of_state"", with the roles of standard, final_state, state_change_process, transition, experiencer, and initial_state respectively.

The *landmark* in the source frame, which is a reference point in the movement, corresponds to the *standard* in the target frame, which is the reference point for the change. The *goal* in the source frame, the destination of the movement, corresponds to the *final_state* in the target frame, the end result of the change. The *motion_x-schema* in the source frame, the process of movement, corresponds to the *state_change_process* in the target frame, the process of change. The *path* in the source frame, the route of the movement, corresponds to the *transition* in the target frame, the process of moving from the initial state to the final state. The *mover* in the source frame, the one who moves, corresponds to the *experiencer* in the target frame, the one who undergoes the change. The *source* in the source frame, the starting point of the movement, corresponds to the *initial_state* in the target frame, the starting point of the change.

The examples provided illustrate these metaphorical connections. For instance, ""He went crazy"" uses the metaphor of physical movement to express a change of mental state. Here, ""he"" is the *mover* or *experiencer*, ""went"" represents the *motion_x-schema* or *state_change_process*, and ""crazy"" is the *goal* or *final_state*. Similarly, ""He fell into a depression"" uses the metaphor of falling into a physical location to express the onset of a mental state, with ""depression"" being the *landmark* or *standard*.

This metaphor allows us to understand abstract changes in terms of concrete physical movements, and it also suggests that changes in state, like movements in space, can be directed, can follow a certain path, and can have a clear beginning and end. This metaphor also implies that changes in state can be experienced or undergone by an individual, just as movements can be performed by an individual. This metaphor thus provides a rich and intuitive way of conceptualizing and talking about changes in state.";"landmark; standard; goal; final_state; motion_x-schema; state_change_process; path; transition; mover; experiencer; source; initial_state; mover; experiencer; motion_x-schema; state_change_process; goal; final_state; landmark; standard"
35;CHANGE_OF_STATE_IS_CHANGE_OF_POSSESSION;Possession_change;Change_of_state;"possessor;possession";"experiencer;state";"I got a headache; My headache went away";"In the metaphor CHANGE_OF_STATE_IS_CHANGE_OF_POSSESSION, the source frame is Possession_change and the target frame is Change_of_state. The roles in the source frame are 'possessor' and 'possession', while in the target frame, they are 'experiencer' and 'state'. 

The metaphorical connection between these roles can be understood in the following way: The 'possessor' in the source frame corresponds to the 'experiencer' in the target frame, and the 'possession' in the source frame corresponds to the 'state' in the target frame. This suggests that the change of possession is metaphorically mapped onto the change of state. 

In the provided examples, ""I got a headache"" and ""My headache went away"", the person (I/my) is the 'experiencer' who undergoes a 'state' change (getting a headache and the headache going away). This is metaphorically linked to the 'possessor' gaining or losing a 'possession'. 

Conceptually, this metaphor hinges on the idea of *ownership* and *control*. Just as one has control over their possessions and can gain or lose them, one also experiences changes in their physical or emotional state. The headache is viewed as something that can be 'acquired' or 'lost', much like a possession. 

This metaphor also implies a sense of *passivity* on the part of the 'experiencer'. The headache comes and goes, much like possessions can be gained or lost, often outside of our control. This reflects the often involuntary nature of physical or emotional state changes.

Furthermore, this metaphor encapsulates the concept of *transformation*. Just as possessions can transform a person's status or situation, changes in state (like getting a headache) can transform a person's experience or condition. 

In summary, the metaphor CHANGE_OF_STATE_IS_CHANGE_OF_POSSESSION draws a parallel between the dynamics of possession and the experience of state changes, underpinned by concepts of *ownership*, *control*, *passivity*, and *transformation*.";"ownership; control; passivity; transformation; ownership; control; passivity; transformation"

The source role is structure_whole and the target role is right. The metaphorical connection between these roles is that *rights*, like physical structures, are seen as *foundational* and *supportive* elements that uphold a society or a country. 

The example ""One down of the three pillars of unalienable rights that hold up this great country of ours"" illustrates this connection. Here, rights are metaphorically depicted as *pillars*, a type of physical structure that provides support and stability. This suggests that rights are viewed as *essential* and *stabilizing* forces that maintain the integrity and functionality of a country. 

The second example, ""This is an us-against-them battle but the 'them' are those who would dismantle our rights"", further emphasizes the metaphorical connection. The act of dismantling a physical structure is used to represent the threat to citizens' rights. This implies that rights, like physical structures, can be *damaged* or *destroyed*, leading to instability or collapse. 

The metaphor also suggests the concept of *protection*. Just as physical structures provide shelter and security, rights protect citizens from abuses and injustices. The metaphor also implies a sense of *collective ownership* and *responsibility*. Just as a physical structure belongs to and is maintained by its owners or inhabitants, rights belong to citizens who must defend and uphold them. 

The metaphor also conveys the idea of *visibility*. Physical structures are tangible and visible, suggesting that rights should be clearly defined and recognized. This contrasts with the often abstract and intangible nature of rights, highlighting the need for their explicit articulation and enforcement. 

Finally, the metaphor implies a sense of *permanence* and *durability*. Physical structures, especially those like pillars, are designed to last. This suggests that rights, too, should be enduring and resistant to change or erosion. 

In summary, the metaphor CITIZEN_RIGHTS_ARE_PHYSICAL_STRUCTURES conceptualizes rights as foundational, protective, collectively owned, visible, and enduring elements that uphold a society or a country, similar to how physical structures function.";"rights; foundational; supportive; pillars; essential; stabilizing; damaged; destroyed; protection; collective ownership; responsibility; visibility; permanence; durability"
37;COGNIZING_IS_BODILY_FUNCTIONING;Cognizing;Bodily_functioning;"body;bodily_functioning_x-schema";"mind;cognizing_x-schema";"My mind was racing; My mind is tired";"In the metaphor COGNIZING_IS_BODILY_FUNCTIONING, the source frame is Cognizing and the target frame is Bodily_functioning. The source role is body;bodily_functioning_x-schema and the target role is mind;cognizing_x-schema. The examples provided are ""My mind was racing"" and ""My mind is tired"".

This metaphorical connection suggests that the process of thinking or cognizing is likened to the physical functioning of the body. The mind, in this case, is metaphorically represented as a physical entity that can experience fatigue or acceleration, similar to how a body can feel tired or be in a state of rapid movement. 

Conceptually, this metaphor implies that *cognitive processes* are as *integral and essential* to our being as *bodily functions*. Just as our bodies can tire from physical exertion, our minds can also become exhausted from cognitive exertion. Similarly, the mind can race, akin to how our heart races when we are excited or anxious. This metaphor also suggests the *interconnectedness* of the mind and body, reinforcing the idea that mental states can have physical manifestations and vice versa.

Linguistically, the phrases ""My mind was racing"" and ""My mind is tired"" use verbs typically associated with physical actions (racing, tired) to describe mental states, further reinforcing the metaphorical connection between cognizing and bodily functioning.

The metaphor also implies a deeper dynamic, that of *regulation and balance*. Just as the body needs rest after exertion to maintain health, the mind also requires periods of rest or relaxation after intense cognitive activity. This can be seen as a parallel to the concept of *homeostasis* in bodily functioning.

Furthermore, the metaphor might suggest the concept of *capacity* or *limitation*. Just as the body has physical limitations, the mind also has its cognitive boundaries. Overstepping these boundaries can lead to fatigue, just as overexertion can lead to physical tiredness.

Lastly, the metaphor might also imply the concept of *performance*. Just as physical performance can vary based on factors like health, fitness, and rest, cognitive performance can also fluctuate based on similar factors like mental health, cognitive fitness (knowledge, skills), and mental rest.";"cognitive processes; integral and essential; bodily functions; interconnectedness; regulation and balance; homeostasis; capacity; limitation; performance"
38;COMMUNICATING_IS_DRAWING_A_PICTURE;Draw_a_picture;Communication;"audience;drawer";"addressee;communicator";"Do I have to draw a picture for you ; He painted an idyllic picture of their life togethe";"In the metaphor COMMUNICATING_IS_DRAWING_A_PICTURE, the source frame is 'Draw_a_picture' and the target frame is 'Communication'. The roles in the source frame are 'audience' and 'drawer', which correspond to 'addressee' and 'communicator' in the target frame. 

Conceptually, this metaphor suggests that communication is a creative process akin to drawing a picture. The *communicator* (drawer) is the one who creates the message (picture), while the *addressee* (audience) is the one who receives and interprets it. This metaphor implies that communication, like drawing, involves *creativity*, *expression*, and *interpretation*. 

Linguistically, the examples provided, ""Do I have to draw a picture for you"" and ""He painted an idyllic picture of their life together"", illustrate how the act of communicating (drawing a picture) can be used to convey complex ideas or emotions. The phrase ""draw a picture"" is used metaphorically to mean 'explain in detail', highlighting the *clarity* and *detail* involved in effective communication. The phrase ""painted an idic picture"" is used to describe the act of creating a vivid, often idealized, narrative or description, emphasizing the *imagery* and *emotion* that can be conveyed through communication.

In terms of underlying dynamics, this metaphor suggests that communication is not a simple transfer of information, but a complex process that involves *creativity*, *interpretation*, and *understanding*. Just as a picture can convey more than words, effective communication can convey more than just the literal meaning of the words used. It also implies that, like a picture, communication can be *subjective*, open to different interpretations by different people. 

Furthermore, the metaphor also implies that communication, like drawing, requires *skill* and *practice*. Just as a skilled artist can create a more effective picture, a skilled communicator can convey their message more effectively. 

Finally, this metaphor also suggests that communication, like a picture, can be *permanent* and *impactful*. Just as a picture can leave a lasting impression, so too can effective communication.";"communicator; addressee; creativity; expression; interpretation; clarity; detail; imagery; emotion; creativity; interpretation; understanding; subjective; skill; practice; permanent; impactful"
39;COMMUNICATING_IS_GUIDING;Guided_motion;Communication;"follower;leader";"addressee;communicator";This book will guide you step by step how to apply for citizenship;"In the metaphor COMMUNICATING_IS_GUIDING, the source frame is Guided_motion and the target frame is Communication. The roles in the source frame are the follower and the leader, which correspond to the addressee and the communicator in the target frame. 

Conceptually, this metaphor draws a parallel between the dynamics of a guided journey and the process of communication. The *leader* in the source frame is akin to the *communicator* in the target frame. Just as the leader guides the follower through a physical path, the communicator guides the addressee through a path of understanding. This guidance can be seen as a form of *direction* or *instruction*, which are key concepts in both guiding and communicating. 

Linguistically, the example ""This book will guide you step by step how to apply for citizenship"" illustrates this metaphor. The book (communicator) is guiding (communicating) the reader (addressee) through the process of applying for citizenship. The phrase ""step by step"" emphasizes the *sequential* and *progressive* nature of both guiding and communicating. 

The metaphor also implies a sense of *trust* and *reliance* on the part of the follower/addressee towards the leader/communicator. Just as the follower trusts the leader to guide them safely and correctly, the addressee trusts the communicator to provide accurate and helpful information. 

Furthermore, the metaphor suggests a *goal-oriented* process. In guided motion, the goal is reaching a certain destination. In communication, the goal could be understanding a concept, learning a skill, or making a decision. This shared focus on achieving a goal underscores the connection between the two frames.

Finally, the metaphor also conveys the idea of *transformation*. Just as the follower changes their location through guided motion, the addressee changes their knowledge or understanding through communication. This transformation is facilitated by the leader/communicator, further highlighting their crucial role.";"leader; communicator; direction; instruction; sequential; progressive; trust; reliance; goal-oriented; transformation"

The metaphorical connections between roles in the source frame and those in the target frame are as follows:

- The transferred_object in the source frame corresponds to the message in the target frame. This suggests that a *message* is metaphorically viewed as an *object* that can be transferred from one person to another. This connection highlights the *tangibility* of messages in communication, emphasizing that they are concrete entities that can be given, received, and understood.

- The transfer_recipient in the source frame corresponds to the addressee in the target frame. This implies that the person receiving the message (addressee) is metaphorically seen as the recipient of a transferred object. This connection underscores the *active reception* involved in communication, where the addressee must accept and understand the message.

- The transferor in the source frame corresponds to the communicator in the target frame. This suggests that the person sending the message (communicator) is metaphorically viewed as the one transferring an object. This connection highlights the *active role* of the communicator in initiating the transfer of the message.

- The vehicle_for_transfer in the source frame corresponds to the language in the target frame. This implies that the language used to communicate the message is metaphorically seen as the vehicle that carries the transferred object. This connection emphasizes the *instrumentality* of language in communication, serving as the medium through which messages are transferred.

The examples provided further illustrate these metaphorical connections. For instance, ""You gave me a great idea!"" metaphorically treats the idea (message) as an object that can be given (transferred). ""Try to pack more thoughts into fewer words"" metaphorically treats thoughts (messages) as objects that can be packed into words (language/vehicle_for_transfer). 

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the *exchange* and *transfer* of ideas, thoughts, or information, which are abstract concepts, through concrete processes akin to physical object transfer. This metaphor also encompasses nuances such as *clarity of message*, *efficiency of transfer*, *reception and understanding*, and *choice of language or words*.";"message; object; tangibility; active reception; active role; instrumentality; exchange; transfer; clarity of message; efficiency of transfer; reception and understanding; choice of language or words"
41;COMMUNICATING_IS_SHOWING;Cause_to_see;Communication;"perception_causer;shower;seer;seen_object";"communicator;communicator;addressee;message";"Let me illustrate the theory with some examples; I'm now going to show you that you are wrong ";"In the metaphor COMMUNICATING_IS_SHOWING, the source frame is 'Cause_to_see' and the target frame is 'Communication'. The source roles include 'perception_causer', 'shower', 'seer', and 'seen_object', while the target roles include 'communicator', 'communicator', 'addressee', and 'message'. 

Conceptually, this metaphor draws a parallel between the act of causing someone to see something and the process of communication. The 'perception_causer' or 'shower' in the source frame corresponds to the 'communicator' in the target frame. This suggests that the act of communication is likened to the act of causing someone to see something, or showing something to someone. The 'seer' in the source frame corresponds to the 'addressee' in the target frame, indicating that the person to whom the communication is directed is likened to the person who is caused to see something. The 'seen_object' in the source frame corresponds to the 'message' in the target frame, suggesting that the content of the communication is likened to the object that is shown or caused to be seen.

Linguistically, this metaphor is exemplified in phrases such as ""Let me illustrate the theory with some examples"" and ""I'm now going to show you that you are wrong"". In these examples, the act of communicating (illustrating a theory, proving someone wrong) is expressed through verbs associated with showing or causing to see (illustrate, show).

This metaphor involves several key concepts. One is the concept of *transparency*, as the act of showing something implies making it visible or clear. This aligns with the goal of communication, which is to make a message clear to the addressee. Another key concept is *intentionality*, as both showing something to someone and communicating a message involve a deliberate act by the communicator or perception_causer. A third key concept is *reception*, as both the seer in the source frame and the addressee in the target frame are required to receive and process the information being shown or communicated.

The metaphor also encompasses nuances such as *persuasion* and *convincing*, as shown in the example ""I'm now going to show you that you are wrong"". Here, the act of showing is not just about making something visible, but also about convincing the seer or addressee of a certain point of view. This aligns with the role of communication in persuasion and argumentation. 

Overall, the metaphor COMMUNICATING_IS_SHOWING captures the dynamics of communication as an act of making something clear, intentional, and persuasive, paralleling it with the act of causing someone to see something.";"transparency; intentionality; reception; persuasion; convincing"
42;CONSCIOUSNESS_IS_VERTICALITY;Verticality;Consciousness;"state_of_uprightness;upright_entity";"state_of_consciousness;conscious_entity";I'm up! ;"In the metaphor CONSCIOUSNESS_IS_VERTICALITY, the source frame is Verticality and the target frame is Consciousness. The source role is state_of_uprightness or upright_entity, and the target role is state_of_consciousness or conscious_entity. The example given is ""I'm up!"" which is a colloquial way to express that one is awake or conscious.

The metaphorical connection between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame is based on the conceptual tie between *verticality* and *consciousness*. In the physical world, being upright or vertical is often associated with being active, alert, and engaged. This is contrasted with being horizontal, which is often associated with rest, sleep, or unconsciousness. Therefore, the state of verticality or uprightness is metaphorically linked to the state of consciousness.

This metaphor also implies a *transformation* from a state of unconsciousness (lying down) to a state of consciousness (standing up). Just as one physically rises from a horizontal position to a vertical one, one metaphorically ""rises"" from unconsciousness to consciousness. This transformation is not merely physical but also mental and perceptual, involving a shift in awareness and engagement with the world.

Furthermore, the metaphor suggests a *dichotomy* between consciousness and unconsciousness, paralleling the dichotomy between up and down in physical space. Just as up and down are opposite directions, consciousness and unconsciousness are opposite states of being. This dichotomy is inherent in our conceptualization of both physical space and mental states.

Finally, the metaphor implies a certain *effort* or *action* required to achieve consciousness, similar to the effort required to maintain an upright position. This highlights the active nature of consciousness, as opposed to the passive state of unconsciousness. 

In summary, the metaphor CONSCIOUSNESS_IS_VERTICALITY connects the roles of the source frame (Verticality) and the target frame (Consciousness) through the concepts of *transformation*, *dichotomy*, and *effort*. It uses the physical experience of verticality to conceptualize the abstract process of becoming conscious, highlighting the active, dynamic nature of consciousness.";"verticality; consciousness; transformation; dichotomy; effort; action; transformation; dichotomy; effort"
43;CONSCIOUS_IS_UP;Verticality;Consciousness;"state_of_uprightness;upright_entity";"state_of_consciousness;conscious_entity";Wake up! ;"In the metaphor CONSCIOUS_IS_UP, the source frame is Verticality and the target frame is Consciousness. The source role is the state of uprightness or an upright entity, while the target role is the state of consciousness or a conscious entity. The example given is ""Wake up!""

The metaphorical connection between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame is that the state of being upright is metaphorically linked to the state of being conscious. This is a conceptual tie that is deeply ingrained in our language and thought processes. We often use phrases like ""wake up"" or ""rise and shine"" to denote the transition from a state of unconsciousness (sleep) to consciousness (awake). This metaphorical connection is also reflected in our physical experiences, as we usually stand upright when we are awake and lie down when we are asleep.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the concept of *transition* from one state to another, similar to the transition from lying down to standing up. This transition is not just physical but also mental, as it involves a change in our cognitive state from unconsciousness to consciousness. 

Another key concept in this metaphor is *activation*. Just as standing up requires the activation of our muscles and senses, waking up involves the activation of our cognitive faculties. This metaphor thus encapsulates the idea that consciousness is an active state, requiring effort and energy to maintain, just like standing upright.

Moreover, the metaphor also implies a *hierarchy* between the states of consciousness and unconsciousness, with the former being superior or more desirable. This is reflected in the verticality frame, where up is usually associated with positive values and down with negative ones. 

Finally, the metaphor also suggests a *binary opposition* between consciousness and unconsciousness, similar to the opposition between up and down. This binary opposition is, however, more complex and nuanced, as there are different levels and states of consciousness and unconsciousness, just like there are different positions along the vertical axis.";"transition; activation; hierarchy; binary opposition"
44;CONTROL_IS_A_BOUNDED_REGION;Bounded_region;Control;"center;proximal_region";"controlling_entity;scope_of_control";"His actions are beyond my control; The whole situation spiraled out of our control; He returned to power ; The president is in control of the executive branch; President Mubarak has stepped down from power";"In the metaphor CONTROL_IS_A_BOUNDED_REGION, the source frame is Bounded_region and the target frame is Control. The roles in the source frame are 'center' and 'proximal_region', which metaphorically correspond to 'controlling_entity' and 'scope_of_control' in the target frame.

The 'center' of a bounded region is the point from which all boundaries are defined. This is conceptually tied to the 'controlling_entity' in the target frame, which is the entity that exercises control. The 'controlling_entity' is metaphorically the 'center' of the control, from which the boundaries of control are defined.

The 'proximal_region' in the source frame refers to the area close to the center. This is metaphorically linked to the 'scope_of_control' in the target frame, which refers to the area or range within which the controlling entity exercises control. The 'scope_of_control' is metaphorically the 'proximal_region' of the control, the area close to the controlling entity where its influence is strongest.

The examples provided illustrate these metaphorical connections. For instance, ""His actions are beyond my control"" suggests that the speaker's 'scope_of_control' does not extend to the other person's actions. This is metaphorically similar to saying that the person's actions are outside the 'proximal_region' of the speaker's control.

The phrase ""The president is in control of the executive branch"" suggests that the president, as the 'controlling_entity', has the executive branch within his 'scope_of_control'. This is metaphorically similar to saying that the executive branch is within the 'proximal_region' of the president's control.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the conceptualization of control as a spatial phenomenon. Control is seen as having a 'center' (the controlling entity) and a 'proximal_region' (the scope of control), just like a bounded region. This metaphor allows us to understand abstract concepts like control in more concrete, spatial terms.

Key concepts in this metaphor include *centralization* and *boundary definition*. In a bounded region, the center is the point from which all boundaries are defined. Similarly, in control, the controlling entity is the central point from which the boundaries of control are defined. Another key concept is *proximity*, which refers to the closeness of something to the center. In control, the scope of control refers to the area close to the controlling entity where its influence is strongest.";"centralization; boundary definition; proximity"
45;CONTROL_IS_A_POSSESSION;Possession;Control;"possess_relation_status;possess_relation;possession;possessor";"control_relation_status;control_relation;ability_to_control;controlling_entity";"He has control over all the workers ; The president kept his hold on power; She regained control of the assembly; He possesses the power to heal small animals";"In the metaphor CONTROL_IS_A_POSSESSION, the source frame is Possession and the target frame is Control. The roles in the source frame, such as possess_relation_status, possess_relation, possession, and possessor, are metaphorically linked to the roles in the target frame, such as control_relation_status, control_relation, ability_to_control, and controlling_entity. 

The metaphorical connection between these roles can be seen in the examples provided. For instance, ""He has control over all the workers"" and ""He possesses the power to heal small animals"" both imply a sense of ownership or possession over something, whether it's control or power. 

Conceptually, this metaphor suggests that *control*, like a *possession*, is something that can be acquired, owned, and exercised by an individual or entity. This is reflected in the linguistic ties between the roles in the source and target frames. For example, the role of 'possessor' in the source frame corresponds to the 'controlling_entity' in the target frame, both of which denote the entity that has the possession or control. Similarly, 'possession' in the source frame corresponds to 'ability_to_control' in the target frame, both of which denote what is being owned or controlled.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the concept of *power dynamics* and *authority*. Just as one has authority over their possessions, a controlling entity has authority and power over what they control. This metaphor also implies a sense of *exclusivity* and *dominance*, as possessions are typically exclusive to the possessor, and control often involves a dominant-submissive relationship.

Furthermore, the metaphor suggests a *transferability* aspect. Just as possessions can be given, taken, or lost, control can also be transferred, gained, or lost, as seen in the example ""She regained control of the assembly"". 

Finally, the metaphor implies a sense of *responsibility*. Just as a possessor has a responsibility towards their possessions, a controlling entity has responsibilities towards what they control. This is especially evident in the example ""The president kept his hold on power"", which suggests a responsibility to maintain control.";"control; possession; power dynamics; authority; exclusivity; dominance; transferability; responsibility"
46;CONTROL_IS_OBJECT_MANIPULATION;Object_manipulation;Control;"object;actor";"dependent_entity;controlling_entity";He's putty in her hands;"In the metaphor CONTROL_IS_OBJECT_MANIPULATION, the source frame is Object_manipulation and the target frame is Control. The roles in the source frame are the object and the actor, while in the target frame, the roles are the dependent_entity and the controlling_entity. 

The metaphorical connection between these roles is that the object in the source frame corresponds to the dependent_entity in the target frame, and the actor in the source frame corresponds to the controlling_entity in the target frame. This metaphor suggests that control, like object manipulation, involves an actor (or controlling entity) exerting influence or direction over an object (or dependent entity).

The example ""He's putty in her hands"" illustrates this metaphor. Here, ""he"" is the dependent_entity (or object) being manipulated or controlled, and ""her"" is the controlling_entity (or actor) doing the manipulation or control. The phrase ""putty in her hands"" implies that ""he"" is easily shaped or influenced by ""her"", much like how putty can be easily manipulated by hands.

Conceptually, this metaphor highlights the dynamics of *power* and *influence* in relationships. The controlling_entity has the *authority* or *capability* to shape or direct the dependent_entity, much like an actor can manipulate an object. This metaphor also implies a certain level of *passivity* or *malleability* on the part of the dependent_entity, as represented by the putty in the example. 

Furthermore, the metaphor suggests a *unilateral* or *one-way* relationship, where the controlling_entity has more power or influence than the dependent_entity. This is similar to the relationship between an actor and an object in object manipulation, where the actor has the ability to change or influence the object, but not vice versa.

In addition, the metaphor may also imply a certain level of *skill* or *expertise* on the part of the controlling_entity, as manipulating an object effectively often requires knowledge and practice. This could be paralleled with the idea of *strategic control* or *calculated influence* in the target frame. 

Overall, the metaphor CONTROL_IS_OBJECT_MANIPULATION encapsulates complex dynamics of power, influence, passivity, unilateral relationships, and strategic control, all under the simple concept of object manipulation.";"power; influence; authority; capability; passivity; malleability; unilateral; one-way; skill; expertise; strategic control; calculated influence"
47;CONTROL_IS_UP;Verticality;Control;higher_positioned_entity;controlling_entity;"I am on top of the situation ; He's in a superior position ; He's in the high command ; He's in the upper echelon ; His power rose";"In the metaphor CONTROL_IS_UP, the source frame is Verticality, and the target frame is Control. The source role is the higher_positioned_entity, and the target role is the controlling_entity. This metaphorical connection implies that being in a higher position is associated with having control or power. 

Conceptually, this metaphor is rooted in our physical and social experiences. In the physical world, being higher often means having a better view or perspective, which can translate into an advantage or control. For example, a person on a hill can see more than a person at the bottom. Similarly, in social hierarchies, those at the top often have more power or control. 

Linguistically, phrases like ""I am on top of the situation"", ""He's in a superior position"", ""He's in the high command"", ""He's in the upper echelon"", and ""His power rose"" all use words or phrases associated with height or upward movement to denote control or power. 

In this metaphor, the *higher_positioned_entity* is conceptually linked to the *controlling_entity*. This connection suggests that the higher one's position (either physically or socially), the more control or power one has. This metaphor also implies a dynamic process: as one's position rises (i.e., moves upward), so does one's power or control. 

This metaphor also encompasses nuances such as *dominance & superiority*, *perspective & oversight*, and *ascent paralleled with empowerment*. The concept of *dominance & superiority* is inherent in the idea that being higher up equates to having more control. The concept of *perspective & oversight* is suggested by the physical advantage of being higher up, which can translate into a metaphorical advantage in terms of control. The concept of *ascent paralleled with empowerment* is suggested by phrases like ""His power rose"", which imply that increasing one's height or position leads to increased power or control.";"higher_positioned_entity; controlling_entity; dominance & superiority; perspective & oversight; ascent paralleled with empowerment; dominance & superiority; perspective & oversight; ascent paralleled with empowerment"

The metaphorical connections between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame are as follows:

1. The destructive_process in the source frame corresponds to the corrupting_activities in the target frame. This suggests that corruption, like a destructive natural process, involves actions that lead to damage or destruction. The underlying dynamic here is the *process of deterioration* that both corruption and destructive natural processes entail. 

2. The destructive_effect in the source frame aligns with the corruption_effect in the target frame. This implies that the aftermath of corruption is akin to the aftermath of a destructive natural process - both leave a trail of destruction in their wake. This highlights the *consequences* of both corruption and destructive natural processes.

3. The destroyed_entity in the source frame is linked to the corruption_affectee in the target frame. This suggests that just as a destructive natural process impacts an entity (like a city or ecosystem), corruption affects individuals, organizations, or societies. This connection underscores the *victimhood* inherent in both scenarios.

The metaphor uses the concept of a destructive natural process to illustrate the nature, effects, and victims of corruption. This metaphorical connection is evident in the examples provided, such as ""California Cities Struggling Under Wave of Corruption"" and ""FIFA facing corruption 'tsunami'"". These phrases depict corruption as a powerful, uncontrollable force, much like a tsunami, that causes widespread destruction.

The metaphor also implicitly suggests the *inevitability* and *unpredictability* of corruption, paralleling these characteristics with those of destructive natural processes. Furthermore, it implies a sense of *helplessness* and *desperation* in the face of corruption, similar to the feelings experienced during a natural disaster.

Finally, the metaphor may also hint at the *recovery* and *rebuilding* process that follows both corruption and destructive natural processes, suggesting a potential for resilience and renewal despite the devastation caused.";"process of deterioration; consequences; victimhood; inevitability; unpredictability; helplessness; desperation; recovery; rebuilding"
49;CORRUPTION_IS_DECAY;Decay;Corruption;"decayed_entity;decaying_effect;decaying_process";"corruption_affectee;corrupting_effect;corrupt_activities";Stopping the rot in public life;"In the metaphor CORRUPTION_IS_DECAY, the source frame is Decay and the target frame is Corruption. The metaphorical connections between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame are as follows:

1. The decayed_entity in the source frame corresponds to the corruption_affectee in the target frame. This connection implies that just as a decayed entity is negatively impacted by the process of decay, the corruption affectee is negatively impacted by corruption. This could be an individual, an institution, or a society that suffers from the corrupt activities. The underlying dynamic here is the concept of *deterioration* and *damage* inflicted on the entity or affectee.

2. The decaying_effect in the source frame corresponds to the corrupting_effect in the target frame. This connection suggests that just as decay leads to the degradation and eventual destruction of the entity, corruption leads to moral, ethical, and societal degradation. The underlying dynamic here is the concept of *negative transformation* and *degradation*.

3. The decaying_process in the source frame corresponds to the corrupt_activities in the target frame. This connection implies that just as decay is a process that gradually destroys an entity, corruption is a process that involves a series of corrupt activities leading to the degradation of the corruption affectee. The underlying dynamic here is the concept of *progressive deterioration*.

The example ""Stopping the rot in public life"" linguistically ties the roles of decay (rot) and corruption in public life. Conceptually, it suggests that corruption, like decay, is a destructive process that needs to be halted to prevent further damage. The underlying dynamics here involve concepts of *prevention*, *intervention*, and *restoration*.

In this metaphor, corruption is not just compared to decay in a physical sense, but also in a moral and societal sense. It encompasses nuances such as *moral decay paralleled with corruption*, *spread of decay/corruption*, and *the need for intervention to stop the decay/corruption*.";"deterioration; damage; negative transformation; degradation; progressive deterioration; prevention; intervention; restoration; moral decay paralleled with corruption; spread of decay/corruption; the need for intervention to stop the decay/corruption"
50;CORRUPTION_IS_EROSION;Erosion;Corruption;"eroding_process;eroding_effect;eroded_entity";"corrupt_activities;corrupting_effect;corruption_affectee";Corruption is eroding the public trust in government ;"In the metaphor CORRUPTION_IS_EROSION, the source frame is Erosion and the target frame is Corruption. The metaphorical connections between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame are as follows:

1. The *eroding_process* in the source frame corresponds to *corrupt_activities* in the target frame. This connection implies that corruption, like erosion, is a gradual process that wears away at something over time. This is not a sudden or immediate action, but rather a slow, persistent degradation that may not be immediately noticeable until significant damage has been done.

2. The *eroding_effect* in the source frame aligns with the *corrupting_effect* in the target frame. This suggests that the impact of corruption, like the effect of erosion, is destructive and detrimental. It weakens and diminishes the entity it affects, causing it to lose its original form or function.

3. The *eroded_entity* in the source frame is linked to the *corruption_affectee* in the target frame. This connection indicates that just as erosion affects a physical entity (like a mountain or coastline), corruption affects a societal entity (like a government or institution). The entity subjected to corruption, similar to the entity subjected to erosion, suffers a loss or degradation.

The example given, ""Corruption is eroding the public trust in government,"" illustrates these connections. Here, the *corrupt_activities* (implied but not explicitly stated) are the erosion process, the *corrupting_effect* is the erosion effect, and the *corruption_affectee* (public trust in government) is the eroded entity.

This metaphor also carries deeper, implicit concepts. For instance, the concept of *inevitability* is present in both erosion and corruption. Just as erosion is a natural process that occurs over time, corruption is often seen as an inevitable part of human societies. Additionally, the concept of *prevention and mitigation* is also implied. Just as we can take measures to slow down or prevent erosion, we can also implement policies and practices to prevent or reduce corruption. Finally, the concept of *restoration* is also implied. Just as eroded landscapes can sometimes be restored, so too can trust in government be rebuilt after corruption has been addressed.";"eroding_process; corrupt_activities; eroding_effect; corrupting_effect; eroded_entity; corruption_affectee; corrupt_activities; corrupting_effect; corruption_affectee; inevitability; prevention and mitigation; restoration"
51;CRIME_IS_AN_ANIMAL;Fierce_animal;Crime;"endangering_action;prey;dangerous_animal";"criminal_activity;victim;crime";Crime is a beast ravaging the city;"In the metaphor CRIME_IS_AN_ANIMAL, the source frame is a *Fierce_animal* and the target frame is *Crime*. The metaphorical connections between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame are as follows:

1. The *endangering_action* of a *Fierce_animal* is metaphorically linked to the *criminal_activity* in the target frame. This connection implies that crime, like a dangerous animal, poses a threat to society. This threat is not just physical but also psychological, creating fear and insecurity. This connection also suggests the *unpredictability* and *chaos* associated with both crime and wild animals.

2. The *prey* of a *Fierce_animal* is metaphorically connected to the *victim* of a crime. This connection highlights the vulnerability and helplessness of the victims, who are at the mercy of the predator/criminal. This connection also underscores the *power dynamics* inherent in both situations, with the predator/criminal exerting control and dominance over the prey/victim.

3. The *dangerous_animal* in the source frame is metaphorically linked to the *crime* in the target frame. This connection emphasizes the inherent danger and harm associated with both crime and dangerous animals. It also suggests the *destructive impact* that both can have on the community, as exemplified in the phrase ""Crime is a beast ravaging the city.""

The metaphor CRIME_IS_AN_ANIMAL thus provides a powerful way to conceptualize crime. It portrays crime as a wild, uncontrollable force that wreaks havoc on society, much like a fierce animal. This metaphor also highlights the victims' vulnerability and the power dynamics involved in criminal activities. It underscores the need for *protection* and *vigilance* to prevent becoming a victim, much like one would need to guard against a dangerous animal. Furthermore, this metaphor suggests that dealing with crime requires strength, courage, and strategic planning, similar to how one would approach dealing with a dangerous animal.

In this metaphor, the abstract concept of crime is made more tangible and visceral by comparing it to a physical entity, a fierce animal. This comparison not only enhances our understanding of crime but also evokes strong emotional responses, thereby making the metaphor more impactful.";"Fierce_animal; Crime; endangering_action; Fierce_animal; criminal_activity; unpredictability; chaos; prey; Fierce_animal; victim; power dynamics; dangerous_animal; crime; destructive impact; protection; vigilance"
52;CRIME_IS_A_DISEASE;Disease;Crime;"disease;patient";"criminal_activity;victim";Crime has infected communities everywhere;"In the metaphor CRIME_IS_A_DISEASE, the source frame is Disease and the target frame is Crime. The source roles are disease and patient, and the target roles are criminal activity and victim. The example provided is ""Crime has infected communities everywhere.""

Conceptually, this metaphor draws a parallel between the spread of disease and the proliferation of crime. Both are seen as *negative phenomena* that can *infiltrate* and *damage* a community or an individual. The metaphor implies that just as a disease can infect a patient, crime can 'infect' a victim or a community. This suggests a view of crime as something that is not only harmful but also contagious, capable of spreading and escalating if not properly addressed.

Linguistically, the use of the term ""infected"" in the example sentence serves to strengthen the metaphorical connection between disease and crime. In the context of disease, ""infection"" refers to the process by which a disease invades a host organism, causing harm. In the context of crime, ""infection"" metaphorically refers to the way in which criminal activity can permeate a community, causing harm to its members.

The metaphor also carries implicit concepts of *prevention* and *treatment*. Just as diseases require medical intervention to prevent their spread and treat their symptoms, crime requires legal and social interventions to prevent its occurrence and address its consequences. This metaphor might therefore be used to argue for proactive measures against crime, such as community outreach programs, education, and law enforcement.

Furthermore, the metaphor suggests a *systemic perspective* on crime. Just as diseases can be seen as symptoms of underlying health issues or environmental conditions, crime can be seen as a symptom of underlying social issues or conditions. This could include factors such as poverty, lack of education, or social inequality.

Finally, the metaphor implies a sense of *urgency* and *seriousness*. Diseases, particularly infectious ones, are often seen as urgent matters that require immediate attention. By likening crime to a disease, the metaphor suggests that crime is also a serious issue that requires immediate action.";"negative phenomena; infiltrate; damage; prevention; treatment; systemic perspective; urgency; seriousness"
53;DESIRE_IS_HUNGER;Hunger;Desire;"object_hungered_for;hunger_x-schema;hunger;hungry_person";"desired_object;desire_x-schema;desire;desirer";"He's drooling over a new car ; He hungered for her attention";"The metaphor DESIRE_IS_HUNGER presents a conceptual link between the physical sensation of hunger and the emotional state of desire. The source frame is ""Hunger"", and the target frame is ""Desire"". The roles in the source frame are object_hungered_for, hunger_x-schema, hunger, and hungry_person, which correspond to the roles in the target frame: desired_object, desire_x-schema, desire, and desirer, respectively.

The metaphorical connection between these roles is based on the shared dynamics of *longing* and *craving*. Just as a hungry person longs for the object of their hunger, a desirer craves the object of their desire. This connection is evident in the provided examples: ""He's drooling over a new car"" and ""He hungered for her attention"". The first example uses the physical manifestation of hunger (drooling) to express intense desire for a car. The second example uses the verb ""hungered"" to convey a strong desire for attention.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the concept of *need*. In both hunger and desire, there is a perceived lack or absence of something that is deeply wanted or needed. This need drives the individual to seek fulfillment, whether it's food to satiate physical hunger or an object or experience to satisfy emotional desire.

The metaphor also encompasses the nuances of *intensity* and *urgency*. Hunger is a powerful, primal sensation that demands immediate attention and action. Similarly, intense desire can feel urgent and compelling, driving individuals to act in pursuit of their desires.

Another key concept is *consumption*. In hunger, the goal is to consume food to alleviate the sensation. In desire, the goal is often to 'consume' or obtain the object of desire. This can involve physical consumption, as in the desire for food or drink, or metaphorical consumption, as in the desire for experiences, possessions, or relationships.

Lastly, the metaphor implies a sense of *satisfaction* or *fulfillment* once the desired object is obtained, mirroring the relief and satisfaction that comes from eating when hungry. This satisfaction, however, may be temporary, leading to a cycle of desire and fulfillment, much like the cycle of hunger and eating.";"longing; craving; need; intensity; urgency; consumption; satisfaction; fulfillment"

The roles in the source frame are the mover and the impediment, and in the target frame, they are the actor and the difficulty.

Conceptually, this metaphor draws a parallel between the physical act of moving and the abstract process of taking action or making progress. The mover in the source frame corresponds to the actor in the target frame. Both are entities trying to progress or achieve something. The impediment in the source frame is metaphorically linked to the difficulty in the target frame. Both are obstacles that hinder the progress or movement of the mover/actor.

In the provided examples, the metaphorical connections are evident. In ""Our project has hit a roadblock"", the project is the actor trying to progress, and the roadblock is the difficulty impeding its progress. Similarly, in ""What's holding you back from pursuing your dreams"", the person with dreams is the actor, and whatever is holding them back is the difficulty. In ""They faced some tough problems at the beginning of their marriage but got over them quickly"", the couple is the actor, and the tough problems are the difficulties.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the concept of *struggle* and *overcoming obstacles*. Just as a physical impediment can stop or slow down movement, difficulties can halt or delay actions. However, just as physical impediments can be overcome, so can difficulties. This metaphor also encompasses the concept of *resilience* and *perseverance*, as it implies that despite difficulties, progress is still possible.

The metaphor also suggests a sense of *direction* and *purpose*. In physical movement, the mover usually has a destination or goal. Similarly, in taking action, the actor often has a specific objective. Difficulties or impediments are things that obstruct the path towards these goals or destinations.

Finally, this metaphor implies a sense of *dynamic interaction* between the actor and the difficulty, similar to the interaction between the mover and the impediment. This interaction can involve various strategies and approaches to overcome the difficulty, just as one might find different ways to bypass a physical impediment.";"struggle; overcoming obstacles; resilience; perseverance; direction; purpose; dynamic interaction"

This metaphorical connection is based on the conceptualization of disease treatment as a battle or war against an enemy, which in this case is the disease or the diseased cells.

The source roles in the war frame include war_strategy, weapons, army, fighting, generals, battlefield, and enemy_combatants. These are metaphorically linked to the target roles in the disease treatment frame, which include treatment_strategy, medical_tools_and_medicines, medical_professionals, applying_treatment, doctors, body, and diseased_cells.

The *war_strategy* in the source frame corresponds to the *treatment_strategy* in the target frame. This suggests a conceptual tie between the strategic planning and tactics used in warfare and the systematic approach taken in treating a disease.

The *weapons* used in war are metaphorically linked to *medical_tools_and_medicines* used in disease treatment. This highlights the conceptual tie between the tools used to fight in a war and the medical tools and medicines used to fight against a disease.

The *army* in the source frame corresponds to *medical_professionals* in the target frame. This suggests a conceptual tie between the collective force fighting in a war and the team of medical professionals working together to treat a disease.

The act of *fighting* in war is metaphorically linked to *applying_treatment* in disease treatment. This highlights the conceptual tie between the active engagement in combat and the active process of treating a disease.

The *generals* leading a war are metaphorically linked to *doctors* leading the treatment of a disease. This suggests a conceptual tie between the leadership and decision-making roles in both contexts.

The *battlefield* in the source frame corresponds to the *body* in the target frame. This suggests a conceptual tie between the physical space where a war takes place and the body where the disease is being fought.

Finally, the *enemy_combatants* in war are metaphorically linked to *diseased_cells* in disease treatment. This highlights the conceptual tie between the adversaries in a war and the diseased cells that are the target of treatment.

This metaphor also encompasses implicit concepts such as *resilience & endurance*, *victory & defeat*, *alliances & teamwork*, and *tactics & strategy*. These concepts further enrich our understanding of the dynamics of disease treatment. For example, just as a war requires resilience and endurance, so does the process of treating a disease. Similarly, the concepts of victory and defeat in war parallel the outcomes of disease treatment, where a successful treatment can be seen as a victory over the disease.";"war_strategy; treatment_strategy; weapons; medical_tools_and_medicines; army; medical_professionals; fighting; applying_treatment; generals; doctors; battlefield; body; enemy_combatants; diseased_cells; resilience & endurance; victory & defeat; alliances & teamwork; tactics & strategy"

This metaphor allows us to understand the complex dynamics of an economy by comparing it to a more tangible and familiar object, a machine.

The SourceFrame is the Machine, with roles such as machine_users, machine_entity, functional_status, and purpose_of_machine. The TargetFrame is the Economy, with roles such as economy_participants, economy_whole, economic_efficiency, and purpose_of_economy.

The *machine_users* in the source frame correspond to the *economy_participants* in the target frame. Just as machine users operate and interact with the machine, economy participants (like businesses, consumers, and governments) interact with and influence the economy. This connection highlights the *agency* and *interactivity* inherent in both systems.

The *machine_entity* corresponds to the *economy_whole*. This connection emphasizes the *complexity* and *interconnectedness* of both systems. Just as a machine is composed of various parts working together, an economy is a complex system with numerous interconnected elements.

The *functional_status* of a machine is metaphorically linked to the *economic_efficiency* of an economy. This connection underscores the importance of *performance* and *productivity* in both systems. Just as a well-functioning machine operates efficiently, a healthy economy is characterized by high levels of economic efficiency.

The *purpose_of_machine* corresponds to the *purpose_of_economy*. This connection highlights the *goal-oriented nature* of both systems. Just as a machine is designed and used for a specific purpose, an economy exists to fulfill certain societal needs, such as the production and distribution of goods and services.

The examples provided further illustrate these metaphorical connections. Phrases like ""the economy humming"" and ""the gears of our economic engine... slowly turning"" use language associated with machines to describe the state of the economy. These expressions not only convey the idea of the economy as a machine but also suggest its *dynamic nature* and the *potential for change* in its status.

In conclusion, the ECONOMY_IS_A_MACHINE metaphor provides a framework for understanding the economy by drawing on our knowledge of machines. It highlights key concepts such as *interactivity*, *complexity*, *performance*, *goal-orientation*, *dynamism*, and *potential for change*.";"machine_users; economy_participants; agency; interactivity; machine_entity; economy_whole; complexity; interconnectedness; functional_status; economic_efficiency; performance; productivity; purpose_of_machine; purpose_of_economy; goal-oriented nature; dynamic nature; potential for change; interactivity; complexity; performance; goal-orientation; dynamism; potential for change"
57;EDUCATION_IS_A_RESOURCE;Resource;Education;"resource_user;resource";"education_learner;education_content";A good education is a powerful resource;"In the metaphor EDUCATION_IS_A_RESOURCE, the source frame is Resource and the target frame is Education. The roles in the source frame, resource_user and resource, correspond to the roles in the target frame, education_learner and education_content, respectively.

Conceptually, this metaphor draws a parallel between the dynamics of using a resource and the process of education. A *resource* is something that can be used to achieve a goal or to produce an effect. It is something that is valuable, that can be drawn upon when needed, and that can be used to one's advantage. Similarly, *education* is seen as something valuable that can be drawn upon to achieve personal and professional goals. It is a tool that can be used to produce effects such as personal growth, career advancement, and societal contribution.

Linguistically, the metaphor connects the role of a *resource user* with that of an *education learner*. Just as a resource user utilizes a resource to achieve a desired outcome, an education learner utilizes education to achieve desired learning outcomes. The resource user's interaction with the resource is paralleled with the education learner's interaction with the education content.

The metaphor also connects the role of the *resource* with that of the *education content*. Just as a resource is something that is used by the resource user, education content is something that is used by the education learner. The resource's potential to be used for various purposes is paralleled with the education content's potential to be used for various learning purposes.

This metaphor also implies several key concepts. One is the concept of *investment and return*. Just as resources are invested to yield returns, time and effort are invested in education to yield knowledge and skills. Another concept is *utilization and application*. Just as resources are utilized and applied to achieve goals, education is utilized and applied to achieve learning outcomes. A third concept is *value and worth*. Just as resources have value and worth, education is seen as having value and worth.

Finally, the metaphor suggests a dynamic of *empowerment*. Just as resources empower the resource user to achieve goals, education empowers the learner to achieve learning outcomes. This empowerment can be seen in the example sentence, ""A good education is a powerful resource.""";"resource; education; resource user; education learner; resource; education content; investment and return; utilization and application; value and worth; empowerment"

The metaphorical connections between roles in the source frame and those in the target frame are as follows:

1. The ""prize"" in a game is metaphorically linked to the ""office"" in an election. This suggests that the ultimate goal or reward in an election, like in a game, is to win the office or position. This connection implies a sense of *competition* and *achievement*, where the office is the coveted prize that candidates strive to win.

2. The ""outcome"" of a game is connected to the ""outcome"" of an election. This highlights the shared concept of *determining a result* based on the performance of the players or candidates. Both in games and elections, there is an element of *uncertainty* until the final result is declared.

3. The ""game_player2"" is linked to ""candidate2"" and similarly, ""game_player1"" is linked to ""candidate1"". This suggests that candidates in an election are seen as players in a game, each with their own strategies and skills. This connection implies a sense of *strategy*, *competition*, and *individual performance*.

4. The ""game_event"" is connected to the ""voting_event"". This implies that the process of voting in an election is seen as a pivotal event in the game, possibly the decisive moment that determines the outcome. This connection underscores the importance of *participation* and *decision-making*.

The example given, ""Too often it is post mortem head scratching as if democratic strategists do not realize every candidate is a pawn on the national chessboard"", further illustrates the metaphor. Here, candidates are likened to pawns in a chess game, suggesting that they are *maneuvered* by higher powers (strategists or party leaders) in the larger game of politics. This introduces additional concepts of *manipulation*, *strategy*, and *power dynamics* into the metaphor.

In summary, the metaphor ELECTION_IS_A_GAME encapsulates several key concepts such as *competition*, *achievement*, *uncertainty*, *strategy*, *individual performance*, *participation*, *decision-making*, *manipulation*, and *power dynamics*. These concepts help us understand the complex dynamics of elections by comparing them to the more familiar context of games.";"competition; achievement; determining a result; uncertainty; strategy; competition; individual performance; participation; decision-making; maneuvered; manipulation; strategy; power dynamics; competition; achievement; uncertainty; strategy; individual performance; participation; decision-making; manipulation; power dynamics"

The metaphorical connections between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame are as follows:

1. The *outcome* of a race is compared to the *outcome* of an election. Both involve a winner and possibly multiple losers. The *competition* and *uncertainty* until the end are inherent in both contexts.

2. The *racers* in a race are compared to the *candidates* in an election. Both are the main actors striving for victory. They prepare, strategize, and compete, embodying the *competitive spirit* and *strategic planning*.

3. The *race event* is compared to the *voting event*. Both are the main events where the competition takes place and the outcome is determined. They represent the *culmination* of efforts and the *decisive moment*.

4. The *prize* in a race is compared to the *election office* in an election. Both are the rewards for winning the competition. They symbolize *achievement*, *recognition*, and *authority*.

5. The *racer2* in a race is compared to the *candidate2* in an election. They represent the other competitors in the race or election. This highlights the *multiplicity* of competitors and the *relative nature* of victory and defeat.

The metaphor ELECTION_IS_A_RACE conceptualizes the complex, multifaceted process of elections as a simpler, more tangible process of a race. This metaphor helps to understand the dynamics of elections, such as competition, strategy, uncertainty, and outcome, by relating them to the familiar concepts of a race.

The linguistic ties are evident in phrases like ""front-runner"", ""close race"", ""sprints to election finish line"", ""jockey for position"", ""off and running"", ""starting line of the marathon primary-election campaigns"". These phrases use the language of racing to describe the events and dynamics of elections.

The conceptual ties are in the ideas of *competition*, *strategy*, *uncertainty*, *outcome*, *achievement*, and *authority*. These concepts are common to both races and elections, and the metaphor helps to illuminate these shared dynamics.

This metaphor also carries implicit concepts such as *endurance*, *pace*, and *timing*. Just like a race, an election requires endurance to sustain the campaign, the right pace to keep up with competitors and public sentiment, and perfect timing to peak at the right moment.

Overall, the metaphor ELECTION_IS_A_RACE provides a rich, vivid, and intuitive way to understand the complex dynamics of elections.";"race; election; outcome; outcome; competition; uncertainty; racers; candidates; competitive spirit; strategic planning; race event; voting event; culmination; decisive moment; prize; election office; achievement; recognition; authority; racer2; candidate2; multiplicity; relative nature; competition; strategy; uncertainty; outcome; achievement; authority; endurance; pace; timing"

The roles in the source frame, war.side1 and war.side2, correspond to the roles in the target frame, candidate1 and candidate2.

Conceptually, this metaphor draws a parallel between the competitive, strategic, and confrontational nature of war and the dynamics of an election. Both scenarios involve two sides (or candidates) in a high-stakes struggle for a significant goal (victory in war or winning an election).

Linguistically, this metaphor is reflected in the use of war-related terms to describe election activities. For instance, phrases like ""the fight for the White House,"" ""the war for the presidency,"" ""Both sides girded for battle,"" and ""Mr Romney will likely fight hard"" all use war terminology to depict the election process.

The metaphorical connection between the roles in the source and target frames can be seen in how the candidates are portrayed as combatants in a war. For example, ""Mr Romney will likely fight hard"" suggests that Romney, like a soldier in a war, will use all his resources and strategies to win the election. Similarly, ""Both sides girded for battle"" implies that the candidates (or their teams) are preparing for the election as if it were a battle, with strategies, tactics, and defenses in place.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the *intensity* and *strategic planning* that characterize both war and elections. Both contexts require careful planning, strategic decision-making, and a strong will to overcome the opponent. This metaphor also implies a *zero-sum game* scenario, where one side's gain is the other side's loss, just as in a war.

Moreover, the metaphor suggests an *adversarial* relationship between the candidates, similar to the relationship between opposing sides in a war. This can potentially highlight the divisive nature of elections, where candidates are often pitted against each other in a fierce competition for votes.

Finally, the metaphor also encapsulates the concept of *resilience* and *perseverance*. Just as in war, where soldiers must continue fighting despite setbacks, candidates in an election must also remain resilient in the face of challenges and continue to strive for victory.";"intensity; strategic planning; zero-sum game; adversarial; resilience; perseverance"
61;EMOTIONALLY_INTENSE_IS_HOT;Heat;Emotion;"entity;heat_level";"experiencer;emotion_level";"He is a man of fiery passions; The argument really heated up when she accused him of losing the car on purpose";"In the metaphor EMOTIONALLY_INTENSE_IS_HOT, the source frame is Heat and the target frame is Emotion. The source role is the entity or heat level, while the target role is the experiencer or emotion level. This metaphorical connection is based on the conceptual link between the physical sensation of heat and the intensity of emotions.

The metaphorical connection between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame is as follows: The *entity* or *heat level* in the source frame corresponds to the *experiencer* or *emotion level* in the target frame. This connection is based on the idea that just as heat can be intense or mild, emotions can also be intense or mild.

The linguistic ties between these roles are evident in phrases like ""fiery passions"" and ""heated up"". The word ""fiery"" is used to describe the intensity of the man's passions, drawing a parallel between the heat of a fire and the intensity of emotions. Similarly, the phrase ""heated up"" is used to describe the escalation of an argument, drawing a parallel between the increase in temperature and the increase in emotional intensity.

Conceptually, this metaphor is based on the idea that emotions can be experienced as physical sensations. Just as we can feel heat on our skin, we can also ""feel"" emotions. This metaphor also suggests that just as heat can cause physical discomfort or pleasure, intense emotions can cause psychological discomfort or pleasure.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the *transformation* of physical sensations into emotional experiences. Just as heat can transform a cold room into a warm one, intense emotions can transform a calm situation into a heated one. This metaphor also involves the concept of *escalation*, as both heat and emotions can increase in intensity.

Other implicit concepts in this metaphor include *intensity & extremes*, as both heat and emotions can reach extreme levels; *passion & energy*, as both heat and fiery emotions are associated with passion and energy; and *conflict & tension*, as heated arguments are often characterized by conflict and tension.";"entity; heat level; experiencer; emotion level; transformation; escalation; intensity & extremes; passion & energy; conflict & tension"
62;EMOTIONAL_INTENSITY_IS_TEMPERATURE;Heat;Emotional_intensity;heat_level;emotional_intensity_scale;"As the argument continued things really heated up ; Their relationship cooled off and they soon parted ways ; His mother was always cold and unloving when he was a child";"In the metaphor EMOTIONAL_INTENSITY_IS_TEMPERATURE, the source frame is Heat, and the target frame is Emotional_intensity. The source role is heat_level, and the target role is emotional_intensity_scale. This metaphorical connection is based on the conceptual tie between the physical sensation of temperature and the abstract concept of emotional intensity.

In the source frame, *heat_level* is a measure of the intensity of heat or cold. It is a tangible, physical concept that we can perceive through our senses. The higher the heat level, the hotter it is; the lower the heat level, the colder it is. This concept is directly linked to the target role, *emotional_intensity_scale*, which represents the intensity of emotions. The more intense the emotion, the higher it is on the emotional intensity scale; the less intense the emotion, the lower it is on the scale.

The linguistic tie between these roles is evident in the example sentences. Phrases like ""things really heated up"" and ""their relationship cooled off"" use temperature-related words to describe changes in emotional intensity. The metaphorical connection allows us to understand abstract emotional experiences in terms of more concrete physical experiences.

Diving deeper into the metaphor, we can extract the concept of *escalation and de-escalation*. Just as heat can increase or decrease, so can emotional intensity. This metaphor also encompasses the idea of *visibility and invisibility*. Heat is something we can feel and measure, while emotions are often hidden and intangible. By comparing emotions to temperature, we make them more visible and understandable.

Another key concept is *reactivity*. Just as different materials react differently to heat, people react differently to emotional intensity. Some may thrive under high emotional intensity, while others may prefer a cooler, calmer emotional climate.

Finally, the metaphor also implies a sense of *control or lack thereof*. Just as we can't control the weather or the temperature outside, we often can't control our emotions or their intensity. This lack of control can lead to unpredictable changes in emotional intensity, just as changes in temperature can be unpredictable.";"heat_level; emotional_intensity_scale; escalation and de-escalation; visibility and invisibility; reactivity; control or lack thereof"
63;EMOTIONS_ARE_OBJECTS;Object;Emotion;object;directed_emotion;"You have to set your jealousy aside ; He hid his love from her";"In the metaphor EMOTIONS_ARE_OBJECTS, the source frame is Object and the target frame is Emotion. The source role is object and the target role is directed_emotion. The examples provided are 'You have to set your jealousy aside' and 'He hid his love from her'.

Conceptually, this metaphor suggests that emotions, like objects, can be *manipulated*, *controlled*, *hidden*, or *set aside*. This metaphorical connection implies that emotions, although abstract and intangible, can be dealt with in the same way we handle physical objects.

Linguistically, the verbs used in the examples, 'set' and 'hid', are typically associated with physical objects. Here, they are used to describe actions performed on emotions, reinforcing the metaphorical connection between the source and target frames.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the *externalization* of emotions. By treating emotions as objects, we can visualize them as separate from ourselves, which can help in managing or understanding them. This metaphor also implies a degree of *agency* over our emotions, suggesting that we have the power to control them, much like we control physical objects.

This metaphor also encompasses nuances such as *emotional detachment* and *emotional concealment*. The act of setting an emotion aside can be seen as a form of emotional detachment, where one separates themselves from their feelings. Similarly, hiding an emotion can be seen as a form of emotional concealment, where one suppresses their feelings.

Overall, the metaphor EMOTIONS_ARE_OBJECTS provides a powerful framework for understanding and discussing emotions, by drawing on our everyday experiences with physical objects.";"manipulated; controlled; hidden; set aside; externalization; agency; emotional detachment; emotional concealment"
64;EMOTIONS_ARE_SUBSTANCES;Substance;Emotion;"container_for_substances;substances";"body;emotions";He's filled with jealousy and She's overflowing with love;"In the metaphor EMOTIONS_ARE_SUBSTANCES, the source frame is Substance, and the target frame is Emotion. The source roles are container_for_substances and substances, while the target roles are body and emotions. The metaphorical connections between these roles are as follows:

1. The *container_for_substances* in the source frame is metaphorically linked to the *body* in the target frame. This connection is based on the conceptualization of the body as a vessel or container that can be filled with substances, in this case, emotions. This is evident in the example ""He's filled with jealousy"", where the body is perceived as a container that holds the emotion of jealousy.

2. The *substances* in the source frame are metaphorically connected to *emotions* in the target frame. This connection is based on the conceptualization of emotions as tangible substances that can be contained, filled, or overflowed. This is evident in the example ""She's overflowing with love"", where the emotion of love is perceived as a substance that can overflow from the container (body).

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the *transformation* and *internalization* of emotions. Just as substances can change their state (from being contained to overflowing), emotions can also change their intensity or state (from being controlled to overwhelming). This metaphor also encompasses nuances such as *saturation & fulfillment* (the body being filled or overflowed with emotions), *quality of emotional experience* (the nature of the emotion being positive or negative), and *emotional capacity & tolerance* (the body's ability to contain or overflow with emotions).

In this metaphor, the physical process of filling a container with a substance is compared to the abstract process of experiencing emotions. The metaphor helps to conceptualize the intangible nature of emotions by comparing them to tangible substances, thereby providing a more concrete understanding of emotional experiences.";"container_for_substances; body; substances; emotions; transformation; internalization; saturation & fulfillment; quality of emotional experience; emotional capacity & tolerance"

The metaphorical connection between these two frames is the concept of *movement* and *progression*.

In the source frame, the roles include path, forceful_action, agent, motion, source, and mover. These roles represent the elements involved in causing motion or movement. The agent (or mover) applies forceful_action to cause motion along a path from a source. This can be seen in physical scenarios such as pushing a car or pulling a cart.

In the target frame, the roles include bill_ongoing_status, legislator_enactment_actions, legislators, bill_status_change, bill_initial_status, and bill. These roles represent the elements involved in the process of enacting legislation. The legislators (analogous to the agent or mover in the source frame) perform legislator_enactment_actions (analogous to forceful_action) to change the bill_status (analogous to motion) from its bill_initial_status (analogous to source) to a new bill_ongoing_status (analogous to path).

The metaphorical connection between these roles is established through the concept of *forceful action* leading to *change* or *motion*. In the context of legislation, this metaphor suggests that the process of enacting legislation is not passive or automatic, but requires active, forceful action by legislators. This action is what causes the bill to move along the path from its initial status to its ongoing or final status.

The examples provided, such as ""Democrats Push Through Historic Controversial Health Care Legislation"" and ""The Senate voted 92-5 Tuesday to move the bill forward to a full vote later this week"", highlight this metaphorical connection. The phrases ""push through"" and ""move the bill forward"" linguistically tie the process of enacting legislation to the concept of causing motion along a path.

This metaphor also encompasses deeper dynamics such as *resistance & overcoming obstacles*, *direction & goal orientation*, and *collective effort*. Just like moving an object along a path requires overcoming physical resistance, enacting legislation often involves overcoming political resistance. Similarly, both processes involve a clear direction or goal, and often require a collective effort.";"movement; progression; forceful action; change; motion; resistance & overcoming obstacles; direction & goal orientation; collective effort"

The roles in the source frame are the trajector and the landmark, while the roles in the target frame are the state and the experiencer.

Conceptually, this metaphor connects the idea of a physical object moving in space (trajector) towards a certain point (landmark) with the experience of a certain state (state) by an individual (experiencer). This metaphorical connection is based on the idea that the experience of a state is similar to the movement of an object in space.

Linguistically, this connection is evident in the examples provided. In the sentence ""I can feel a headache approaching"", the headache (state) is metaphorically represented as an object (trajector) moving towards the speaker (experiencer/landmark). Similarly, in the sentence ""My symptoms went away"", the symptoms (state) are represented as an object (trajector) moving away from the speaker (experiencer/landmark).

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the concept of *proximity* and *distance*. In the physical world, objects can be close or far from us. This spatial relationship is used to represent the intensity or presence of an experienced state. If a state is approaching, it means that it is becoming more intense or imminent. If a state is going away, it means that it is becoming less intense or is disappearing.

Another key concept is *perception*. The experiencer is not just passively undergoing a state, but actively perceiving its approach or departure. This adds a layer of subjectivity to the metaphor, as the perception of the state can vary from person to person.

Finally, the concept of *control* is implicit in this metaphor. The movement of the object (state) is usually beyond the control of the experiencer, just like the movement of a physical object in space is often beyond our control. This reflects the often uncontrollable nature of our experiences and states.";"proximity; distance; perception; control"

This metaphor is based on the idea that emotional or mental states can be conceptualized as physical locations that one can be in, out of, or close to.

In the source frame, the roles include 'landmark', 'current_location', 'locale', 'experiencer', and 'x-schema'. These roles are metaphorically linked to the roles in the target frame, which include 'standard', 'experienced_state_value', 'state', 'experiencer', and 'stative_x-schema'.

The 'landmark' in the source frame corresponds to the 'standard' in the target frame. This suggests that the emotional or mental state is viewed as a fixed point of reference, similar to a physical landmark.

The 'current_location' in the source frame is linked to the 'experienced_state_value' in the target frame. This implies that the current emotional or mental state of the experiencer is conceptualized as their current location.

The 'locale' in the source frame corresponds to the 'state' in the target frame. This suggests that the overall environment or context of the experiencer is viewed as the overall emotional or mental state they are in.

The 'experiencer' in both frames is the same, indicating that the person experiencing the state is also the one who is conceptually located in a certain place.

The 'x-schema' in the source frame is linked to the 'stative_x-schema' in the target frame. This suggests a more abstract mapping of the overall structure or pattern of being in a location onto the overall structure or pattern of experiencing a state.

The examples provided further illustrate these metaphorical connections. For instance, ""I'm in love"" uses the preposition 'in' to indicate being at a location, which is metaphorically mapped onto experiencing the state of love. Similarly, ""She's out of her depression"" uses 'out of' to indicate leaving a location, which is metaphorically mapped onto no longer experiencing the state of depression.

This metaphor involves the key concepts of *spatiality*, *orientation*, and *movement*. Just as we navigate physical spaces, we also navigate emotional and mental states. We can be 'in' a state (like being in love), 'out of' a state (like being out of depression), or 'close to' a state (like being close to insanity). This metaphor also suggests that, like physical locations, emotional and mental states can be entered, exited, and approached, reflecting the dynamic nature of our emotional and mental experiences.";"Being_at_a_location; Experiencing_a_state; spatiality; orientation; movement"

The metaphorical connections between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame are as follows:

- The source role of *possess_relation_status* is connected to the target role of *experienced_state_value*. This suggests that the status of possessing an object is metaphorically linked to the value of the state being experienced. This connection implies that the way we perceive and describe our experiences is influenced by the concept of possession. For example, when we say ""I have a headache,"" we are using the language of possession to describe an experience of physical discomfort.

- The source role of *possession* is connected to the target role of *state*. This connection implies that the object being possessed is metaphorically seen as the state being experienced. This suggests that experiences are conceptualized as objects that can be possessed, owned, or controlled.

- The source role of *possessor* is connected to the target role of *experiencer*. This connection implies that the person who possesses an object is metaphorically seen as the person who experiences a state. This suggests that the experiencer has a sense of ownership or control over their experiences, similar to how a possessor has control over their possessions.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the concept of *ownership* and *control*. Just as we have control over the objects we possess, we might feel that we have control over our experiences. However, this is not always the case, as experiences can often be involuntary or uncontrollable, just like the example ""I have a headache.""

Furthermore, this metaphor also involves the concept of *tangibility*. By conceptualizing experiences as objects, they become more tangible and easier to understand and communicate. This is a common strategy in language, where abstract concepts are often described in terms of more concrete, physical entities.

Finally, this metaphor also implies a sense of *temporality*. Just as possessions can be temporary or permanent, so can experiences. This adds another layer of complexity to the metaphor, as it suggests that our experiences can change over time, just like our possessions.";"possess_relation_status; experienced_state_value; possession; state; possessor; experiencer; ownership; control; tangibility; temporality"
69;FORCES_ARE_OBJECTS;Object;Force;"size;object_entity";"force_amount;force";A large force is needed to move a heavy object;"In the metaphor FORCES_ARE_OBJECTS, the source frame is Object;Object, and the target frame is Force;Force. The source role is size;object_entity, and the target role is force_amount;force. The example provided is ""A large force is needed to move a heavy object.""

The metaphorical connection between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame is that the *size* of an object is conceptually linked to the *amount of force* required to move it. This metaphorical connection is based on the physical principle that larger objects typically require more force to move than smaller ones. This connection is both linguistic, as seen in the phrase ""a large force,"" and conceptual, as it relates to our understanding of how physical forces work in the world.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the concept of *proportionality* - the larger the object (source role), the larger the force required (target role). This concept is deeply ingrained in our understanding of the physical world and is reflected in our language and thought processes.

Another key concept in this metaphor is *resistance*. A heavy object, due to its size, presents more resistance to movement, and thus requires a larger force to overcome this resistance. This concept of resistance is implicitly tied to the source role (size;object_entity) and is metaphorically mapped onto the target role (force_amount;force).

In addition, the metaphor also encapsulates the concept of *effort*. The larger the object, the more effort (or force) is needed to move it. This concept is not explicitly stated but is an integral part of the metaphor's underlying dynamics.

In summary, the metaphor FORCES_ARE_OBJECTS connects the roles of size and object in the source frame with the roles of force amount and force in the target frame. This connection is based on the concepts of *proportionality*, *resistance*, and *effort*, which are fundamental to our understanding of physical forces and objects.";"size; amount of force; proportionality; resistance; effort; proportionality; resistance; effort"
70;FORCE_TRANSFER_IS_OBJECT_TRANSFER;Transfer_scenario;Force_transfer;"transferor;transfer_recipient;transferred_object";"force_originator;force_receiver;force";"She gave him a push ; He gave me a vicious kick";"The metaphor at hand is FORCE_TRANSFER_IS_OBJECT_TRANSFER. This metaphorical concept connects the source frame of a Transfer_scenario with the target frame of Force_transfer. The roles in the source frame are transferor, transfer_recipient, and transferred_object, which correspond to the roles in the target frame: force_originator, force_receiver, and force.

The metaphorical connection between these roles is established through the conceptualization of force as an object that can be transferred from one entity to another. This conceptualization allows us to understand and describe forceful actions in terms of object transfer scenarios, which are more tangible and familiar.

The *transferor* in the source frame corresponds to the *force_originator* in the target frame. This connection is based on the idea that both roles involve an entity that initiates a transfer, whether it's an object or a force. The linguistic tie can be seen in the example ""She gave him a push"", where ""she"" is both the transferor of an object and the originator of a force.

The *transfer_recipient* in the source frame is metaphorically linked to the *force_receiver* in the target frame. Both roles receive something from the transferor/force_originator. In the example ""He gave me a vicious kick"", ""me"" is the recipient of the kick (object) and the receiver of the force.

The *transferred_object* in the source frame corresponds to the *force* in the target frame. This connection is based on the conceptualization of force as an object that can be transferred. In the example ""She gave him a push"", the push is the transferred object and also represents the force.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the *transformation* of abstract force into a tangible object, and the *transfer* of this object from one entity to another. This metaphor allows us to understand and describe forceful actions in a more concrete way, by drawing on our experiences and knowledge of object transfer scenarios. It also involves nuances such as the *intentionality* of the force_originator/transferor, the *receptivity* or *resistance* of the force_receiver/transfer_recipient, and the *impact* or *effect* of the transferred force/object.";"transferor; force_originator; transfer_recipient; force_receiver; transferred_object; force; transformation; transfer; intentionality; receptivity; resistance; impact; effect"
71;FUNCTIONALITY_IS_VERTICALITY;Verticality;Functionality;"vertical_entity;scalar_position;verticality_scale";"functional_entity;functional_status;functionality_scale";The servers are back up after having been down for days;"In the metaphor FUNCTIONALITY_IS_VERTICALITY, the source frame is Verticality and the target frame is Functionality. The roles in the source frame are vertical_entity, scalar_position, and verticality_scale, while the roles in the target frame are functional_entity, functional_status, and functionality_scale.

The metaphorical connection between these roles can be understood as follows:

- The *vertical_entity* in the source frame corresponds to the *functional_entity* in the target frame. In the given example, the servers represent both the vertical entity and the functional entity. This suggests a conceptual tie between the physical position of an object and its functional status. Just as a physical object can be up or down, a server (or any functional entity) can be up (functioning) or down (not functioning).

- The *scalar_position* in the source frame corresponds to the *functional_status* in the target frame. This connection implies that the status of functionality is perceived on a vertical scale, where 'up' signifies full functionality and 'down' signifies lack of functionality.

- The *verticality_scale* in the source frame corresponds to the *functionality_scale* in the target frame. This connection suggests that just as verticality can be measured on a scale (from low to high), functionality can also be measured on a scale (from non-functional to fully functional).

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve a conceptual mapping from the domain of physical space (verticality) to the domain of abstract functionality. This mapping allows us to understand abstract concepts (like functionality) in terms of more concrete concepts (like verticality).

Key implicit concepts in this metaphor include *directionality*, *measurement*, and *status change*. The concept of *directionality* is inherent in the verticality-functionality mapping, as 'up' and 'down' directions correspond to 'functional' and 'non-functional' statuses. The concept of *measurement* is implicit in the scalar_position-functionality_status and verticality_scale-functionality_scale connections, as both functionality and verticality are perceived on a scale. The concept of *status change* is implicit in the example, as the servers change from being 'down' (non-functional) to 'up' (functional).

This metaphor also encompasses nuances such as *recovery & restoration* (servers going back up after being down), *temporality* (servers being down for days), and *reliability & instability* (servers being susceptible to going down).";"vertical_entity; functional_entity; scalar_position; functional_status; verticality_scale; functionality_scale; directionality; measurement; status change; directionality; measurement; status change; recovery & restoration; temporality; reliability & instability"

This metaphorical connection is established through the roles in the source frame (Motion_along_a_path) and the target frame (Governing_action).

In the source frame, the roles are 'motion_x-schema', 'mover', and 'goal'. The 'motion_x-schema' represents the overall schema of motion, including the path, direction, and speed. The 'mover' is the entity that moves along the path, and the 'goal' is the destination or the end point of the motion.

In the target frame, the roles are 'governing_action_x-schema', 'governing_actor', and 'governing_objectives'. The 'governing_action_x-schema' represents the overall schema of a governing action, including the process, direction, and speed. The 'governing_actor' is the entity that performs the governing action, and the 'governing_objectives' are the goals or the end points of the governing action.

The metaphorical connection between these roles can be seen in the examples provided. For instance, in the sentence ""Congress moved quickly to avoid a governmental shutdown"", the 'mover' (Congress) is metaphorically linked to the 'governing_actor', and the 'goal' (avoid a governmental shutdown) is metaphorically linked to the 'governing_objectives'. The 'motion_x-schema' (moved quickly) is metaphorically linked to the 'governing_action_x-schema' (the process of avoiding a governmental shutdown).

This metaphor allows us to understand complex governing actions in terms of simpler, more familiar concepts of motion. It highlights the *directionality* and *purposefulness* of governing actions, as well as the *agency* of the governing actors. It also implies that governing actions, like motion, can face obstacles, change direction, or speed up or slow down.

Furthermore, the metaphor suggests that governing actions, like motion, are *progressive* and *transitional*, moving from one state to another. This is similar to the concept of *transformation* in the metaphor ACQUIRING_IDEAS_IS_EATING.

Finally, the metaphor also encompasses nuances such as *strategy & planning* (choosing the right path), *effort & struggle* (overcoming roadblocks), and *evaluation & adjustment* (considering alternative approaches), which are paralleled with the dynamics of motion.";"directionality; purposefulness; agency; progressive; transitional; transformation; strategy & planning; effort & struggle; evaluation & adjustment"

The source role is scalar_position and vertical_entity, while the target role is functional_status and government_whole.

The metaphorical connection between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame is that the *position* or *status* of a government (functional_status; government_whole) is conceptually linked to the *vertical position* or *entity* (scalar_position; vertical_entity). This metaphorical connection is evident in the examples provided: ""The government was toppled"" and ""The government fell"". Both phrases imply a downward movement, which in the context of a government, signifies a decline in functionality or a complete loss of power.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the conceptualization of *government functionality* as a *vertical structure*. This structure can be stable and upright, or it can fall or be toppled, mirroring the rise and fall of governments in political history. The verticality metaphor provides a way to understand and discuss complex political phenomena in more concrete, physical terms.

In this metaphor, the *stability* and *uprightness* of the vertical entity can be seen as representing the *strength* and *effectiveness* of a government. Conversely, the act of falling or being toppled represents a *failure*, *collapse*, or *overthrow* of a government. This metaphorical connection allows for a rich, nuanced discussion of government functionality, incorporating concepts such as *political instability*, *revolution*, and *regime change*.

Furthermore, the verticality metaphor also implies a *hierarchy* within the government, with higher positions signifying more power and lower positions signifying less power. This adds another layer of complexity to the metaphor, allowing for discussions about power dynamics within a government.

In summary, the metaphor GOVERNMENT_FUNCTIONALITY_IS_VERTICALITY uses the concept of verticality to represent the functionality of a government, with the vertical position representing the government's status and the act of falling or being toppled representing a decline or loss of functionality. This metaphor allows for a nuanced discussion of complex political phenomena, incorporating concepts such as stability, hierarchy, and power dynamics.";"position; status; vertical position; entity; government functionality; vertical structure; stability; uprightness; strength; effectiveness; failure; collapse; overthrow; political instability; revolution; regime change; hierarchy"

The source frame, Machine, and the target frame, Government_institution, are connected through various roles that highlight the metaphorical relationship.

The source role 'purpose' corresponds to the target role 'responsibilities'. This suggests that just as a machine has a specific purpose or function, a government institution has certain responsibilities it must fulfill. This connection implies a sense of *duty* and *functionality* that both machines and government institutions share.

The source role 'operating_x-schema' is linked to the target role 'functions'. This connection implies that the way a machine operates, with its various parts working together, is metaphorically similar to how a government institution functions. This highlights the *complexity* and *interconnectedness* of both systems.

The source role 'machine_entity' corresponds to the target role 'government_whole'. This suggests that the entire government institution is viewed as a single machine, emphasizing the *unity* and *cohesiveness* of the institution.

The source role 'functional_status' is connected to the same role in the target frame, 'functional_status'. This suggests that the operational status of a machine is metaphorically similar to the functional status of a government institution. This connection emphasizes the *efficiency* and *productivity* that both machines and government institutions should ideally exhibit.

The examples provided further illustrate these metaphorical connections. For instance, the phrase ""If the injustice is part of the necessary friction of the machine of government"" suggests that problems or injustices in the government are seen as friction in a machine, something that hinders its smooth operation. This highlights the *obstacles* and *challenges* that both machines and government institutions may face.

Similarly, the phrase ""They had elected him Jackson to conduct the Government and to keep and remove its moneys and he meant to do so on the principle that it was a simple machine"" suggests that running a government is seen as operating a machine. This emphasizes the *control* and *management* aspects that are common to both machines and government institutions.

Overall, the metaphor GOVERNMENT_INSTITUTION_IS_A_MACHINE encapsulates several key concepts such as *duty*, *functionality*, *complexity*, *interconnectedness*, *unity*, *cohesiveness*, *efficiency*, *productivity*, *obstacles*, *challenges*, *control*, and *management*.";"duty; functionality; complexity; interconnectedness; unity; cohesiveness; efficiency; productivity; obstacles; challenges; control; management; duty; functionality; complexity; interconnectedness; unity; cohesiveness; efficiency; productivity; obstacles; challenges; control; management"

This metaphorical mapping allows us to understand complex, abstract concepts related to governance and political systems in terms of more concrete, tangible experiences related to physical structures.

The source frame, Physical_structure, includes roles such as foundation_of_structure, structure_whole, structural_framework, and structural_stability. These roles are metaphorically mapped onto the target frame, Government_institution, with corresponding roles such as authority_base, government_whole, authority_structure, and functional_status.

The *foundation_of_structure* in a physical structure is metaphorically linked to the *authority_base* in a government institution. Just as the foundation provides support and stability to a physical structure, the authority base provides legitimacy and stability to a government institution. This metaphorical connection implies that a strong authority base is crucial for the stability and longevity of a government institution.

The *structure_whole* in a physical structure is metaphorically connected to the *government_whole* in a government institution. This suggests that a government institution, like a physical structure, is a complex entity composed of many interconnected parts.

The *structural_framework* in a physical structure is metaphorically linked to the *authority_structure* in a government institution. Just as the structural framework determines the shape and stability of a physical structure, the authority structure determines the organization and stability of a government institution.

The *structural_stability* in a physical structure is metaphorically connected to the *functional_status* in a government institution. This suggests that the stability of a government institution, like the stability of a physical structure, depends on its functional status or performance.

The examples provided illustrate these metaphorical connections. The phrase ""Rising food prices can topple governments"" suggests that governments, like physical structures, can be destabilized and toppled. The phrase ""Afghanistan's government could collapse after 2014"" further reinforces this metaphorical connection, implying that governments, like physical structures, can collapse if their foundation or structural framework is weak.

This metaphor allows us to understand complex political phenomena in terms of familiar physical experiences. It also implies that the stability and longevity of a government institution depend on its authority base, authority structure, and functional status, just as the stability and longevity of a physical structure depend on its foundation, structural framework, and structural stability.";"foundation_of_structure; authority_base; structure_whole; government_whole; structural_framework; authority_structure; structural_stability; functional_status"

This metaphorical connection implies that a government, like an organism, is a complex, living entity that is shaped by its environment and functions as a whole.

The source roles of part_function, health_status, organism, and specialized_parts in the biological entity frame are metaphorically linked to the target roles of position_duties, functional_status, government_whole, and positions in the government institution frame.

The *part_function* in a biological entity can be compared to the *position_duties* in a government institution. Just as each part of an organism has a specific function that contributes to the overall health and functioning of the organism, each position in a government institution has specific duties that contribute to the overall functioning of the government.

The *health_status* of a biological entity is metaphorically linked to the *functional_status* of a government institution. Just as the health status of an organism reflects its overall well-being and ability to function, the functional status of a government reflects its overall health and ability to carry out its duties.

The *organism* in the biological entity frame is linked to the *government_whole* in the government institution frame. This suggests that a government, like an organism, is a complex, interconnected system that functions as a whole.

The *specialized_parts* of a biological entity are metaphorically linked to the *positions* in a government institution. Just as an organism has specialized parts that perform specific functions, a government has specific positions that carry out specific duties.

The example provided by Woodrow Wilson further illustrates these metaphorical connections. He suggests that a government, like a living organism, is shaped by its environment and the tasks it must perform. It cannot function if its parts (or positions) are offset against each other, just as an organism cannot live if its organs are in conflict.

This metaphor encompasses abstract concepts such as *adaptation*, *interdependence*, and *balance*. Just as an organism must adapt to its environment and maintain a balance among its various parts to survive, a government must adapt to its societal environment and maintain a balance among its various positions to function effectively. The metaphor also implies an *organic growth* of the government, shaped by the pressures of life, much like an organism.";"part_function; position_duties; health_status; functional_status; organism; government_whole; specialized_parts; positions; adaptation; interdependence; balance; organic growth"

The roles in the source frame, such as childcare_provider, childcare_duties, children, and childcare_objectives, are metaphorically linked to the roles in the target frame, such as governor, governing_actions, governed, and governor_objectives.

The metaphorical connection between the roles in the source and target frames is based on the conceptualization of the government as a *caregiver* and the citizens as *children*. This metaphor is built on the idea that the government, like a childcare provider, has a responsibility to *nurture*, *protect*, and *guide* its citizens, who are seen as needing such care and guidance.

The role of the childcare_provider is linked to the role of the governor. Both are seen as figures of authority and responsibility. They are expected to make decisions that are in the best interest of those under their care, whether they are children or citizens. This connection highlights the *responsibility* and *authority* inherent in both roles.

The childcare_duties are metaphorically connected to the governing_actions. Both involve tasks and actions aimed at ensuring the well-being and development of those under their care. This connection underscores the *active role* both the childcare provider and the government play in shaping the environment and conditions of their charges.

The children in the source frame are metaphorically connected to the governed in the target frame. Both are seen as needing guidance, protection, and care from the childcare provider or the government. This connection emphasizes the *dependency* and *vulnerability* of the children or citizens.

Finally, the childcare_objectives are linked to the governor_objectives. Both involve goals and aspirations for the well-being and development of the children or citizens. This connection highlights the *aspirational* and *forward-looking* aspects of both roles.

However, the examples provided also reveal a critique of this metaphor. The phrase ""the government shouldn't be a babysitter"" and the reference to the ""nanny state"" suggest a resistance to the idea of the government as a childcare provider. This resistance may stem from a belief in *personal responsibility* and *individual freedom*, which can be seen as being at odds with the *dependency* and *guidance* implied by the childcare metaphor. This tension reflects the complex dynamics of the relationship between the government and its citizens, and the differing views on the role of the government in society.";"caregiver; children; nurture; protect; guide; responsibility; authority; active role; dependency; vulnerability; aspirational; forward-looking; personal responsibility; individual freedom; dependency; guidance"

This metaphor is based on the source frame of Vehicular_motion, which includes roles such as the vehicle, vehicle control, speed, motion, motion controller, passenger, and direction. These roles are mapped onto the target frame of Governing_action, which includes roles such as the affected jurisdiction, governing action, affect rate of change, jurisdiction state, governor, governed, and governing objectives.

The *vehicle* in the source frame corresponds to the *affected jurisdiction* in the target frame. This suggests that just as a vehicle is driven and controlled by the driver, the jurisdiction or the country is directed and controlled by the government. The *vehicle control* in the source frame corresponds to the *governing action* in the target frame, indicating that the government's actions are likened to the control exerted by a driver over a vehicle.

The *speed* in the source frame corresponds to the *affect rate of change* in the target frame. This implies that the pace at which the government implements changes or reforms is compared to the speed at which a vehicle is driven. The *motion* in the source frame corresponds to the *jurisdiction state* in the target frame, suggesting that the state or condition of the jurisdiction is influenced by the government's actions, just as the motion of a vehicle is determined by the driver's actions.

The *motion controller* in the source frame corresponds to the *governor* in the target frame, reinforcing the idea that the government, like a driver, controls the direction and speed of the jurisdiction. The *passenger* in the source frame corresponds to the *governed* in the target frame, suggesting that the citizens are passengers in the vehicle driven by the government, experiencing the effects of the government's actions.

Finally, the *direction* in the source frame corresponds to the *governing objectives* in the target frame. This implies that the government's objectives and goals are likened to the direction in which a driver steers a vehicle.

This metaphor encapsulates several key concepts. The concept of *control* is central, as it highlights the government's role in directing and influencing the state of the jurisdiction. The concept of *motion* or *change* is also important, as it underscores the dynamic nature of governing, with the government's actions causing changes in the state of the jurisdiction. The concept of *direction* or *objective* is crucial, as it emphasizes the government's goals and the direction it aims to take the jurisdiction. Lastly, the concept of *passenger* or *governed* underscores the impact of the government's actions on the citizens.";"vehicle; affected jurisdiction; vehicle control; governing action; speed; affect rate of change; motion; jurisdiction state; motion controller; governor; passenger; governed; direction; governing objectives; control; motion; change; direction; objective; passenger; governed"

The roles in the source frame are leader_goal, leader_motion_x-schema, and leader, while the roles in the target frame are governor_objectives, governing_actions, and governor.

The metaphorical connections between the roles in the source and target frames are as follows:

1. *leader_goal* is metaphorically connected to *governor_objectives*. In the source frame, a leader sets goals for the group or organization they are leading. Similarly, in the target frame, a governor or government sets objectives for the state or country they are governing. This connection highlights the *direction-setting* role of both leaders and governments.

2. *leader_motion_x-schema* is metaphorically connected to *governing_actions*. The motion schema in the source frame refers to the leader's actions or strategies to achieve the set goals. In the target frame, governing actions refer to the policies or measures implemented by the government to achieve its objectives. This connection underscores the *strategic and operational* aspects of both leadership and governance.

3. *leader* is metaphorically connected to *governor*. Both roles denote the *authority* and *responsibility* of guiding and making decisions for a group or a state/country.

The examples provided further illustrate these metaphorical connections. For instance, US Senator Pete Domenici's statement emphasizes the government's role as a leader in promoting energy efficiency. The government, like a leader, sets the *direction* (leader_goal/governor_objectives) through its policies (leader_motion_x-schema/governing_actions) and is expected to lead by example (leader/governor).

Similarly, Natalia Rose's blog entry implies that the government, like a leader, has the power to influence people's actions and decisions, especially when they lack knowledge or awareness. This highlights the *influential* and *guiding* role of the government (leader/governor), and the potential consequences of its actions (leader_motion_x-schema/governing_actions) on its objectives (leader_goal/governor_objectives).

In this metaphor, the underlying dynamics involve *authority*, *responsibility*, *influence*, and *direction-setting*, which are inherent in both leadership and governance.";"leader_goal; governor_objectives; direction-setting; leader_motion_x-schema; governing_actions; strategic and operational; leader; governor; authority; responsibility; direction; influential; guiding; authority; responsibility; influence; direction-setting"

The roles in the source frame are children, parents, and the family as a whole, while the roles in the target frame are the governed, the governor, and the jurisdiction region.

The metaphorical connections between these roles are as follows:

1. Parents (source role) are metaphorically connected to the governor (target role). Just as parents have the responsibility of taking care of their children, making decisions for their welfare, and guiding them, the governor or the government has the responsibility of taking care of its citizens, making decisions for their welfare, and guiding them. This connection highlights the *responsibility* and *guidance* that both parents and the government provide.

2. Children (source role) are metaphorically connected to the governed (target role). Just as children are under the care and guidance of their parents, the citizens (governed) are under the care and guidance of the government (governor). This connection emphasizes the *dependence* and *trust* that both children and citizens place in their caregivers.

3. The family as a whole (source role) is metaphorically connected to the jurisdiction region (target role). The family unit is a microcosm of the larger society or jurisdiction. The dynamics within a family, such as cooperation, conflict resolution, and shared responsibilities, mirror the dynamics within a society or jurisdiction. This connection underscores the *interdependence* and *cohesion* within both a family and a jurisdiction.

The phrase ""Parens Patriae"" literally means 'parent of the country', and traditionally refers to the role of the state as sovereign and guardian of persons under legal disability. This concept further strengthens the metaphorical connection between the roles of parents and the government, emphasizing the *protection* and *guardianship* that both provide.

In this metaphor, the underlying dynamics involve concepts of *authority*, *responsibility*, *protection*, *guidance*, *dependence*, *trust*, *interdependence*, and *cohesion*. These concepts are inherent in both the roles of parents within a family and the government within a society.";"responsibility; guidance; dependence; trust; interdependence; cohesion; protection; guardianship; authority; responsibility; protection; guidance; dependence; trust; interdependence; cohesion"

The roles in the source frame are ""person"", ""objectives"", and ""actions"", while the roles in the target frame are ""governor"", ""governor_objectives"", and ""governing_actions"".

The metaphorical connections between these roles are as follows:

1. ""Person"" in the source frame is metaphorically connected to ""governor"" in the target frame. This connection implies that the government, like a person, has its own will, emotions, and actions. For instance, in the example, the US government is portrayed as having feelings of love towards its citizens, much like a person would.

2. ""Objectives"" in the source frame is metaphorically connected to ""governor_objectives"" in the target frame. This connection suggests that the government, like a person, has its own goals and objectives. In the example, the government's objective is to protect its citizens, even if it means causing them temporary discomfort or pain.

3. ""Actions"" in the source frame is metaphorically connected to ""governing_actions"" in the target frame. This connection implies that the government, like a person, takes actions to achieve its objectives. In the example, the government's action is to ""shackle your legs together"" as a means of protection.

The linguistic ties between these roles are evident in the language used to describe the government's actions and objectives. The government is described as ""loving"" its citizens and taking actions to ""protect"" them, language typically used to describe a person's actions and objectives.

Conceptually, this metaphor presents the government as a parental figure, as indicated by the phrase ""tough love baby"" and the reference to the frame of punishing a child. This suggests an underlying dynamic of *authority* and *responsibility*, where the government, like a parent, has the authority to make decisions for its citizens and the responsibility to protect them, even if it means causing them temporary discomfort or pain.

This metaphor also encompasses nuances such as *sacrifice* and *pain*, as the government is portrayed as willing to cause itself pain in order to protect its citizens. This can be compared to a parent's willingness to sacrifice their own comfort for the sake of their child's safety.

Furthermore, the metaphor implies a sense of *unilateral decision-making*, as the government, like a parent, makes decisions on behalf of its citizens without necessarily consulting them. This reflects the dynamics of a parent-child relationship, where the parent has the final say in decisions affecting the child.";"authority; responsibility; sacrifice; pain; unilateral decision-making"

The roles in the source frame are objectives, shepherd, shepherding activities, and sheep, which correspond to governor objectives, governor, governing actions, and governed in the target frame.

The metaphorical connections between these roles are as follows:

1. The *shepherd* in the source frame corresponds to the *governor* in the target frame. This connection implies that the government, like a shepherd, has the responsibility of guiding, protecting, and providing for the people, who are likened to sheep. This connection highlights the *authority* and *responsibility* of the government.

2. The *sheep* in the source frame corresponds to the *governed* in the target frame. This connection suggests that the people, like sheep, are dependent on the government for guidance and protection. This connection underscores the *dependence* and *vulnerability* of the people.

3. The *shepherding activities* in the source frame correspond to *governing actions* in the target frame. This connection implies that the actions of the government, like those of a shepherd, are aimed at ensuring the welfare and safety of the people. This connection highlights the *duties* and *functions* of the government.

4. The *objectives* of the shepherd in the source frame correspond to the *governor objectives* in the target frame. This connection suggests that the goals of the government, like those of a shepherd, are to ensure the well-being and prosperity of the people. This connection emphasizes the *purpose* and *mission* of the government.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve concepts such as *guidance*, *protection*, *dependence*, *authority*, and *responsibility*. These concepts are inherent in the roles of a shepherd and are transferred to the roles of a government in the metaphor. The metaphor also implies a certain *power dynamic* between the government and the people, with the government having the authority and responsibility to guide and protect, and the people being dependent on the government for their well-being. This metaphor can be seen as both a critique and an endorsement of government, depending on one's perspective. On one hand, it can be seen as endorsing the idea that the government should have a guiding and protective role. On the other hand, it can be seen as critiquing the idea that the people are passive and dependent, like sheep.";"shepherd; governor; authority; responsibility; sheep; governed; dependence; vulnerability; shepherding activities; governing actions; duties; functions; objectives; governor objectives; purpose; mission; guidance; protection; dependence; authority; responsibility; power dynamic"
83;GROUPS_ARE_CONTAINERS;Containing;Group;"contents;container";"members;group";This group contains twenty members;"In the metaphor GROUPS_ARE_CONTAINERS, the source frame is Containing and the target frame is Group. The roles in the source frame are contents and container, while the roles in the target frame are members and group. The metaphorical connections between these roles are as follows:

- The 'container' in the source frame corresponds to the 'group' in the target frame. This connection is based on the conceptual similarity between a physical container that holds objects and a group that includes members. Both the container and the group serve as *boundaries* or *structures* that hold or include other entities within them.

- The 'contents' in the source frame correspond to the 'members' in the target frame. This connection is based on the conceptual similarity between objects contained within a physical container and members included within a group. Both the contents and the members are entities that are held or included within a larger structure.

The metaphor GROUPS_ARE_CONTAINERS implies several key concepts:

- *Inclusion*: Just as a container includes its contents, a group includes its members. This concept is central to the metaphor and is reflected in the example sentences 'This group contains twenty members' and 'There are twenty members in this group'.

- *Boundaries*: Just as a container has physical boundaries that separate its contents from the outside world, a group has metaphorical boundaries that distinguish its members from non-members. This concept is implicit in the metaphor and is reflected in the use of the word 'contains' to describe the relationship between a group and its members.

- *Quantity*: Just as the capacity of a container can be measured by the number of objects it contains, the size of a group can be measured by the number of its members. This concept is reflected in the example sentences, which specify the number of members in the group.

- *Identity*: Just as the contents of a container contribute to its identity (e.g., a box of apples), the members of a group contribute to its identity (e.g., a group of students). This concept is implicit in the metaphor and is reflected in the use of the word 'members' to describe the individuals that make up a group.

- *Organization*: Just as a container provides a structure for organizing its contents, a group provides a structure for organizing its members. This concept is implicit in the metaphor and is reflected in the use of the word 'group' to describe a collection of individuals organized for a particular purpose.";"boundaries; structures; Inclusion; Boundaries; Quantity; Identity; Organization"
84;GROUPS_ARE_PART-WHOLE_STRUCTURES;Part_whole;Group;"part;whole";"members;group";Earth is part of the group of 'terrestrial' planets;"In the metaphor GROUPS_ARE_PART-WHOLE_STRUCTURES, the source frame is Part_whole and the target frame is Group. The source roles are 'part' and 'whole', and the target roles are 'members' and 'group'. The example given is ""Earth is part of the group of 'terrestrial' planets"". Here, 'part' corresponds to Part_Wholepart [Source] and 'group' corresponds to Groupgroup [Target].

The metaphorical connection between the source frame and the target frame is the concept of *inclusion* and *belonging*. In the source frame, a 'part' belongs to a 'whole', just as in the target frame, 'members' belong to a 'group'. This metaphorical connection is linguistically expressed through the phrase ""is part of"", which signifies the relationship of a part to a whole, and metaphorically, the relationship of a member to a group.

Conceptually, this metaphor also implies the idea of *interdependence* and *cohesion*. Just as a 'part' contributes to the integrity of the 'whole', a 'member' contributes to the cohesion and functionality of the 'group'. This is a key concept that underlies the dynamics of this metaphor.

Another implicit concept in this metaphor is *identity*. Just as a 'part' shares the identity of the 'whole' it belongs to, a 'member' shares the identity of the 'group' it belongs to. For example, Earth is identified as a 'terrestrial' planet because it is part of the group of terrestrial planets.

Furthermore, the metaphor also suggests a sense of *hierarchy* or *order*. In a part-whole structure, parts are subordinate to the whole, just as members are subordinate to the group in a group structure. This hierarchy is not necessarily about power or control, but rather about the organization and structure that allows the whole or the group to function effectively.

Finally, the metaphor also implies the concept of *variety within unity*. Just as a 'whole' is composed of different 'parts', a 'group' is composed of different 'members'. This variety within unity is a key characteristic of both part-whole structures and groups, and is a crucial dynamic underlying this metaphor.";"inclusion; belonging; interdependence; cohesion; identity; hierarchy; order; variety within unity"
85;GROUPS_ARE_POSSESSORS;Possession;Group;"possessor;possession";"group;members";The Milky Way belongs to a cluster of galaxies;"In the metaphor GROUPS_ARE_POSSESSORS, the source frame is Possession, and the target frame is Group. The roles in the source frame are possessor and possession, which correspond to the roles of group and members in the target frame, respectively.

The metaphorical connection is established by mapping the dynamics of possession onto the concept of groups. The possessor in the source frame is metaphorically linked to the group in the target frame. This connection implies that just as a possessor *owns* or *controls* a possession, a group metaphorically *possesses* or *controls* its members. This metaphorical connection is linguistically manifested in the example sentence ""The Milky Way belongs to a cluster of galaxies"", where 'The Milky Way' is a member (possession) of 'a cluster' (group/possessor).

The possession in the source frame is metaphorically linked to the members in the target frame. This connection suggests that just as possessions are *owned* or *controlled* by the possessor, members are metaphorically *owned* or *controlled* by the group. This is conceptually manifested in the example sentence where 'The Milky Way' is a member (possession) of 'a cluster' (group/possessor).

The verb 'belongs to' linguistically embodies the metaphorical connection between the source and target frames. It signifies the *ownership* or *control* that the possessor (group) has over the possession (member), reinforcing the metaphor GROUPS_ARE_POSSESSORS.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve concepts of *ownership*, *control*, and *membership*. Just as a possessor has control and ownership over a possession, a group is perceived to have a similar control and ownership over its members. This metaphor allows us to understand groups in terms of familiar dynamics of possession, thereby simplifying the complex social dynamics involved in group membership.

The metaphor also implies a sense of *belonging* and *identity*, as possessions are often seen as extensions of the possessor's identity. Similarly, members can be seen as integral parts of the group, contributing to its collective identity.";"owns; controls; possesses; controls; owned; controlled; owned; controlled; ownership; control; ownership; control; membership; belonging; identity"

The source role is the follower in the guided motion, and the target role is the actor in the action. The metaphorical connection between these roles is that the follower in the guided motion metaphorically becomes the actor in the action.

This metaphor is built on the conceptual tie between *guidance* and *motion*. In the source frame, the follower is guided along a path, which is a physical journey. This journey is not random or aimless, but directed and purposeful, guided by another entity. This concept of *purposeful movement* is then mapped onto the target frame of Action, where the actor is performing a task or action.

The examples provided further illustrate this metaphorical connection. In each case, the phrase ""guided him through"" is used to describe the action of helping someone navigate a complex problem or situation. This phrase evokes the image of a physical journey, where one person is leading another along a path. This metaphorical journey represents the process of working through a problem or task, with the guide providing direction and support.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the concepts of *direction*, *support*, and *collaboration*. Just as a guide provides direction and support to a follower on a physical journey, so too does a guide provide direction and support to an actor in an action or task. This metaphor also implies a collaborative relationship between the guide and the actor, similar to the relationship between a guide and a follower in a physical journey.

In addition, the metaphor also encompasses the concept of *progression*. Just as a physical journey involves moving from one place to another, so too does an action or task involve progression from a starting point to an endpoint. This progression is not always straightforward or easy, as indicated by the phrase ""rough parts of the course"". However, with guidance and support, the actor is able to navigate these challenges and continue moving forward.

In summary, the metaphor GUIDED_ACTION_IS_GUIDED_MOTION_ALONG_A_PATH connects the roles of follower in guided motion and actor in action through the concepts of *guidance*, *direction*, *support*, *collaboration*, and *progression*.";"guidance; motion; purposeful movement; direction; support; collaboration; progression; guidance; direction; support; collaboration; progression"
87;GUNS_ARE_A_DISEASE;Disease;Personal_weapon;disease;weapon;America's gun disease is a national security issue;"In the metaphor GUNS_ARE_A_DISEASE, the source frame is Disease and the target frame is Personal_weapon. The source role is disease and the target role is weapon. The metaphorical connection between these roles is established through the conceptualization of guns as a disease.

On a linguistic level, the metaphor is expressed through the phrase ""America's gun disease,"" which directly equates guns with a disease. This phrase implies that guns, like a disease, are a harmful and destructive force that is spreading uncontrollably throughout America.

Conceptually, this metaphor draws on our understanding of diseases as something that spreads, causes harm, and needs to be controlled or eradicated. By equating guns with a disease, the metaphor suggests that guns are not just tools or objects, but a harmful force that is spreading and causing damage. This conceptualization of guns as a disease implies a need for intervention, just as diseases require medical intervention.

The metaphor also implies that, like a disease, the issue of guns is not isolated but affects the entire nation. This is reflected in the phrase ""a national security issue,"" which suggests that the spread of guns poses a threat to the safety and well-being of the entire nation.

Key concepts in this metaphor include *spread*, *harm*, *control*, and *intervention*. The concept of *spread* relates to the way diseases, and by extension guns, proliferate across a population. The concept of *harm* relates to the damage caused by both diseases and guns. The concept of *control* relates to the need to manage or limit the spread of diseases and guns. Finally, the concept of *intervention* relates to the actions taken to control or eradicate diseases, and by extension, the actions that might be taken to control or limit the use of guns.

This metaphor also encompasses nuances such as *contagion paralleled with proliferation*, *treatment paralleled with regulation*, and *prevention paralleled with gun control*.";"spread; harm; control; intervention; spread; harm; control; intervention; contagion paralleled with proliferation; treatment paralleled with regulation; prevention paralleled with gun control"
88;GUNS_ARE_DRUGS;Addiction;Personal_weapon;addicting_thing;weapon;The primary reason Americans are addicted to guns is due to the National Rifle Association's very effective and immoral campaign to instill fear into the heart of our citizens which has paralyzed the soul of America;"In the metaphor GUNS_ARE_DRUGS, the source frame is Addiction and the target frame is Personal_weapon. The source role is the addicting_thing, which in this case is drugs, and the target role is the weapon, which is guns.

Conceptually, this metaphor draws a parallel between the compulsive need for drugs in an addict and the perceived need for guns among Americans. The metaphor suggests that just as drugs can have a destructive impact on an individual's life, guns can have a destructive impact on society.

Linguistically, the phrase 'Americans are addicted to guns' directly links the concept of addiction to the possession of guns. The word 'addicted' is typically associated with substance abuse, and its use here implies an unhealthy dependency on guns.

The metaphor also implies a sense of *compulsion* and *dependency*, similar to how an addict feels compelled to use drugs and becomes dependent on them. This is reflected in the statement 'The primary reason Americans are addicted to guns is due to the National Rifle Association's very effective  and immoral  campaign to instill fear into the heart of our citizens'. This suggests that the perceived need for guns is not a personal choice, but a result of external manipulation, similar to how drug addiction can be triggered by external factors.

The metaphor also implies a sense of *loss of control* and *enslavement*. Just as an addict loses control over their life due to drugs, the metaphor suggests that Americans have lost control over their safety due to their dependency on guns. The phrase 'which has paralyzed the soul of America' implies that this dependency on guns has had a debilitating effect on the country, similar to how drug addiction can paralyze an individual's life.

Lastly, the metaphor implies a sense of *harm* and *destruction*. Just as drug addiction can lead to physical and mental harm, the metaphor suggests that the addiction to guns can lead to societal harm and violence. This is reflected in the phrase 'immoral  campaign to instill fear into the heart of our citizens', which suggests that the proliferation of guns has led to a climate of fear and violence.";"compulsion; dependency; loss of control; enslavement; harm; destruction"
89;GUNS_ARE_OBJECTS_OF_WORSHIP;Worship;Gun_possession;"worshipped_thing;worshipper";"gun;gun_owner";"altar of gun ownership ; worship guns ; glorify firearms";"In the metaphor GUNS_ARE_OBJECTS_OF_WORSHIP, the source frame is Worship, and the target frame is Gun_possession. The source roles are the worshipped_thing and the worshipper, while the target roles are the gun and the gun_owner.

Conceptually, this metaphor draws a parallel between the reverence, devotion, and respect typically associated with religious worship and the perceived value, importance, and respect given to guns by gun owners. This metaphor suggests that for some, guns are not just tools or objects, but symbols that hold a significant place in their lives, akin to a religious artifact or deity in a worship context.

Linguistically, the metaphor uses terms associated with worship, such as 'altar' and 'glorify', in the context of gun ownership, reinforcing the connection between these two frames. The 'altar of gun ownership' suggests a sacred space or platform where guns are revered, while 'worship guns' and 'glorify firearms' imply a deep admiration or reverence for guns, similar to how a worshipper might glorify or worship a deity.

The metaphorical connection between the worshipped_thing and the gun highlights the *elevation* of guns from mere objects to symbols of reverence. This connection implies a *transformation* of perception, where the gun is not just seen as a tool, but as an object of deep significance and respect.

The connection between the worshipper and the gun_owner suggests a *role alignment*. Just as the worshipper shows reverence and devotion to the worshipped thing, the gun owner shows a similar reverence and devotion to guns. This connection implies a *transfer of devotion*, where the intensity of religious fervor is paralleled in the fervor of gun ownership.

The metaphor also implies a sense of *ritualistic behavior* associated with gun ownership, similar to the rituals performed in worship. This could include the care and maintenance of guns, the act of shooting, or even the purchase of guns.

Finally, the metaphor suggests an *emotional attachment* and *identity formation* associated with gun ownership. Just as religious worship often forms a significant part of a person's identity, this metaphor suggests that gun ownership can similarly become a defining aspect of a person's identity.";"elevation; transformation; role alignment; transfer of devotion; ritualistic behavior; emotional attachment; identity formation"
90;GUNS_ARE_PESTS;Pest;Personal_weapon;pest;weapon;gun-infested state;"In the metaphor GUNS_ARE_PESTS, the source frame is Pest and the target frame is Personal_weapon. The source role is pest and the target role is weapon. The example given is 'gun-infested state'.

The metaphorical connections between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame are quite profound. The term 'pest' is generally associated with creatures that are harmful, destructive, and unwanted. They are seen as a nuisance that people want to get rid of. When this concept is mapped onto the target frame of personal weapons, it suggests that guns, like pests, are harmful, destructive, and unwanted.

This metaphor implies a strong negative connotation towards guns. It suggests that guns, like pests, are a problem that needs to be dealt with. They are seen as a source of harm and destruction, rather than a means of protection or defense. This metaphor also implies that, like pests, guns are pervasive and hard to get rid of.

The term 'gun-infested state' further reinforces this metaphorical connection. Just as pests infest a place and make it uninhabitable, guns are seen as infesting a state and making it unsafe.

The key concepts in this metaphor are *harm & destruction*, *unwanted presence*, and *pervasiveness*. These concepts are associated with pests and are metaphorically transferred to guns. This metaphor also suggests a sense of *urgency* and *necessity for action* to deal with the 'infestation' of guns.

This metaphor also encompasses nuances such as *fear & anxiety* associated with the presence of pests (and guns), and the *difficulty in eradication*, paralleling the challenges in controlling pest populations with those in controlling gun proliferation.

Overall, this metaphor paints a vivid picture of guns as a societal problem that needs to be addressed, much like a pest infestation.";"harm & destruction; unwanted presence; pervasiveness; urgency; necessity for action; fear & anxiety; difficulty in eradication"
91;GUN_CONTROL_REGULATION_IS_A_MOTION_IMPEDIMENT;Motion-affecting_objects;Gun_control_legislation;mover;affected_people;"saddle the American people with gun control ; gun control trap";"In the metaphor GUN_CONTROL_REGULATION_IS_A_MOTION_IMPEDIMENT, the source frame is Motion-affecting_objects, and the target frame is Gun_control_legislation. The source role is the mover, and the target role is the affected_people.

Conceptually, this metaphor suggests that gun control regulation, like a physical object that impedes motion, restricts or slows down the freedom of the affected people (the movers). It implies that the regulation is a burden or a trap, hindering the progress or movement of the people.

Linguistically, the metaphor uses terms associated with physical motion and obstacles ('saddle', 'trap') to describe the effects of gun control legislation. This creates a vivid image of the legislation as a physical barrier or burden that the American people must carry or navigate around.

The metaphorical connection between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame is that the *mover* (in the source frame) is equated with the *affected_people* (in the target frame). The *motion-impeding object* (in the source frame) is equated with *gun control regulation* (in the target frame).

This metaphor carries implicit concepts of *restriction* and *burden*. Just as a physical object can restrict or slow down motion, gun control regulation is seen as restricting or slowing down the freedoms of the people. The metaphor also implies a sense of *struggle* or *effort* needed to overcome the impediment, similar to the effort required to move a physical object out of one's path.

Furthermore, the metaphor suggests a *negative impact* of gun control regulation on the people, paralleling the negative effect of a physical impediment on motion. This reflects a perspective that views gun control regulation as an obstacle to individual freedom, rather than a measure for public safety.

Finally, the metaphor implies a *passive role* for the affected people, who are acted upon by the regulation (the motion-impeding object), rather than being active agents in their own right. This could reflect a perception of powerlessness or lack of agency in the face of government regulation.";"mover; affected_people; motion-impeding object; gun control regulation; restriction; burden; struggle; effort; negative impact; passive role"
92;HEALTH_IS_VERTICALITY;Verticality;Health;"state_of_uprightness;upright_entity";"state_of_health;healthy_entity";He's down with the flu;"In the metaphor HEALTH_IS_VERTICALITY, the source frame is Verticality and the target frame is Health. The source role is the state of uprightness or an upright entity, while the target role is the state of health or a healthy entity. The example given is ""He's down with the flu.""

The metaphorical connection between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame is that the *state of uprightness* is metaphorically linked to the *state of health*, and the *upright entity* is metaphorically linked to the *healthy entity*. This metaphorical connection is based on the conceptual tie between verticality and health, where being upright is associated with being healthy, and being down or horizontal is associated with being sick or unhealthy.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the concept of *balance*. Just as an upright entity maintains a balance to stay vertical, a healthy entity maintains a balance of bodily functions to stay healthy. When this balance is disrupted, the entity is no longer upright or healthy. This is reflected in the example ""He's down with the flu,"" where ""down"" metaphorically signifies a state of illness, or a disruption of health balance.

Another key concept here is *stability*. An upright entity is stable, and this stability is metaphorically transferred to the concept of a healthy entity. When one is ""down with the flu,"" their health stability is compromised.

The metaphor also implies a *directional aspect*. In physical space, 'up' is often associated with positivity and strength, while 'down' is linked to negativity and weakness. Similarly, in the health context, being 'up' metaphorically represents a state of good health, while being 'down' signifies illness or poor health.

Lastly, the metaphor encompasses the concept of *control*. Just as an upright entity has control over its posture, a healthy entity has control over its health. When one is ""down with the flu,"" they have lost this control, mirroring the loss of control an upright entity experiences when it falls or is knocked down.";"state of uprightness; state of health; upright entity; healthy entity; balance; stability; directional aspect; control"

The metaphorical connections between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame are as follows:

1. The *lower_points_in_structure* in the source frame corresponds to the *inferior_points_in_hierarchy* in the target frame. This connection implies that the lower positions in a physical structure are metaphorically linked to the lower-ranking positions in a hierarchy. This connection suggests a conceptual tie of *relative position* and *inferiority*.

2. The *higher_positions_in_structure* in the source frame corresponds to the *superior_points_in_hierarchy* in the target frame. This connection implies that the higher positions in a physical structure are metaphorically linked to the higher-ranking positions in a hierarchy. This connection suggests a conceptual tie of *relative position* and *superiority*.

3. The *position_in_structure* in the source frame corresponds to the *item_in_hierarchy* in the target frame. This connection implies that the position of an item in a physical structure is metaphorically linked to the position of an item in a hierarchy. This connection suggests a conceptual tie of *placement* and *rank*.

4. The *vertical_physical_structure* in the source frame corresponds to the *hierarchical_structure* in the target frame. This connection implies that the vertical arrangement of a physical structure is metaphorically linked to the arrangement of a hierarchy. This connection suggests a conceptual tie of *structure* and *order*.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the comparison of a hierarchy to a vertical structure, which is a tangible, physical entity. This comparison allows for the abstract concept of a hierarchy to be understood in more concrete terms. The metaphor also encompasses nuances such as *upward mobility* (climbing the structure parallels ascending in rank), *stability & rigidity* (the structure's solidity mirrors the often inflexible nature of hierarchies), and *visibility & transparency* (the clear view of the structure's top and bottom parallels the observable ranks in a hierarchy).

The example ""He's gone over my head to the top supervisor"" illustrates these connections, as ""going over someone's head"" implies bypassing a lower point in the hierarchy to reach a higher one, mirroring the act of climbing a vertical structure.";"Vertical_structure; Hierarchy; lower_points_in_structure; inferior_points_in_hierarchy; relative position; inferiority; higher_positions_in_structure; superior_points_in_hierarchy; relative position; superiority; position_in_structure; item_in_hierarchy; placement; rank; vertical_physical_structure; hierarchical_structure; structure; order; upward mobility; stability & rigidity; visibility & transparency"

Chemistry students usually can write acceptable exposition if they know good writing is expected ";"In the metaphor IDEAS_ARE_FOOD, the source frame is Food, with roles of food_consumer and food, while the target frame is Idea, with roles of idea_cognizer and idea_self. The metaphorical connections between these roles are based on the conceptualization of ideas as food items that can be consumed, digested, and assimilated by the mind, similar to how food is consumed, digested, and assimilated by the body.

The role of *food_consumer* in the source frame corresponds to the role of *idea_cognizer* in the target frame. This connection is based on the conceptual tie that both consumers and cognizers are the ones who intake, process, and utilize the food or ideas respectively. They are the active agents who engage with the food or ideas, and their actions determine the outcome of the consumption or cognition process.

The role of *food* in the source frame corresponds to the role of *idea_self* in the target frame. This connection is based on the conceptual tie that both food and ideas are the objects of consumption or cognition. They are what is taken in, processed, and utilized by the consumer or cognizer. The quality, nature, and characteristics of the food or ideas can significantly impact the consumption or cognition process.

The examples provided illustrate these metaphorical connections. In the first example, facts are described as being ""more indigestible than evolution,"" suggesting that these facts, like indigestible food, are difficult for the society (the idea_cognizer) to process and understand. The phrase ""ideas are indigestible food"" further reinforces this metaphorical connection.

In the second example, the phrase ""Food for thought must be appetizing"" suggests that ideas, like appetizing food, should be appealing and stimulating to the mind (the idea_cognizer) in order to be effectively processed and utilized. The implication is that good writing (the idea_self) is expected from chemistry students (the idea_cognizer), just as appetizing food is expected from a good cook (the food_consumer).

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve concepts such as *digestibility paralleled with comprehensibility*, *appetizing paralleled with appealing*, and *indigestibility paralleled with incomprehensibility*. These concepts highlight the similarities between the physical process of consuming food and the mental process of cognizing ideas, emphasizing the importance of quality, appeal, and digestibility in both processes.";"food_consumer; idea_cognizer; food; idea_self; digestibility paralleled with comprehensibility; appetizing paralleled with appealing; indigestibility paralleled with incomprehensibility"
95;IDEAS_ARE_OBJECTS;Object;Idea;object_entity;idea_self;You'd need an electron microscope to find the point of this essay;"In the metaphor IDEAS_ARE_OBJECTS, the source frame is ""Object"" and the target frame is ""Idea"". The source role is ""object_entity"" and the target role is ""idea_self"". The example given is: ""You'd need an electron microscope to find the point of this essay"" (Reddy 1979).

This metaphorical connection implies that *ideas*, like *objects*, have a tangible, physical presence that can be examined, manipulated, and understood. The metaphor suggests that ideas, like objects, have a *size* and *location* that can be pinpointed. In the example, the point of the essay (the idea) is so small that it would require an electron microscope to find it. This implies that the idea is not only difficult to grasp, but also minuscule and perhaps insignificant.

The metaphor also suggests a *process of discovery or exploration*, similar to how one would use an electron microscope to explore the microscopic world. This implies that understanding ideas may require careful, detailed examination and a willingness to delve into the complex, intricate details.

Furthermore, the metaphor implies that ideas, like objects, can be *hidden* or *obscure*. Just as an object might be too small to see with the naked eye, an idea might be too complex or subtle to understand without careful analysis. This highlights the *challenge* and *effort* required to understand complex ideas.

Lastly, the metaphor suggests that ideas, like objects, can be *measured* or *quantified*. The use of an electron microscope implies a level of precision and accuracy, suggesting that ideas can be evaluated and assessed in a similar manner. This introduces the concept of *evaluation* and *judgment* in understanding and interpreting ideas.

In summary, the metaphor IDEAS_ARE_OBJECTS encapsulates several key concepts: *tangibility*, *size and location*, *discovery and exploration*, *hidden or obscure nature*, *challenge and effort*, and *measurement and evaluation*.";"ideas; objects; size; location; process of discovery or exploration; hidden; obscure; challenge; effort; measured; quantified; evaluation; judgment; tangibility; size and location; discovery and exploration; hidden or obscure nature; challenge and effort; measurement and evaluation"
96;IDEAS_ARE_POSSESSIONS;Possession;Idea;"possession;possessor";"idea_self;idea_cognizer";"I have an idea ; She gave me a good idea ; Keep your opinion to yourself!";"In the metaphor IDEAS_ARE_POSSESSIONS, the source frame is Possession and the target frame is Idea. The roles in the source frame are possession and possessor, while in the target frame, the roles are idea_self and idea_cognizer.

The metaphorical connection between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame can be understood as follows: The *possession* in the source frame corresponds to the *idea_self* in the target frame. This implies that ideas are treated as tangible objects that can be owned, given, or kept. The *possessor* in the source frame corresponds to the *idea_cognizer* in the target frame, suggesting that the person who has the idea is the owner of that idea, similar to how a person owns a possession.

The linguistic ties between these roles are evident in the examples provided. Phrases like ""I have an idea"" and ""She gave me a good idea"" use language typically associated with physical possessions to describe the conceptual process of thinking and sharing ideas. Similarly, ""Keep your opinion to yourself"" uses the language of possession to convey the concept of retaining one's thoughts or ideas.

Conceptually, this metaphor encapsulates the dynamics of *ownership*, *transfer*, and *control* over ideas. Just as possessions are owned, ideas are perceived as being owned by the individual who conceived them. The act of sharing or giving an idea is metaphorically likened to the transfer of a possession from one person to another. The phrase ""Keep your opinion to yourself"" implies a sense of control or restriction over one's ideas, akin to how one might control access to their possessions.

This metaphor also implies the concept of *value*. Just as possessions can have value, so too can ideas. This is evident in the phrase ""She gave me a good idea"", where the idea is not just transferred, but also appraised for its quality or value.

Furthermore, the metaphor suggests a sense of *individuality* and *uniqueness* of ideas. Just as possessions can be unique to the possessor, ideas are unique to the idea_cognizer. This uniqueness is often a reflection of the individual's personal experiences, knowledge, and perspective, much like how possessions can reflect the owner's tastes and preferences.

In conclusion, the metaphor IDEAS_ARE_POSSESSIONS draws a parallel between the tangible world of possessions and the intangible world of ideas, highlighting concepts of ownership, transfer, control, value, individuality, and uniqueness.";"possession; idea_self; possessor; idea_cognizer; ownership; transfer; control; value; individuality; uniqueness"

The metaphorical connection is established through the conceptualization of *importance* as *size*. This metaphor allows us to understand abstract concepts like importance in terms of more concrete, tangible concepts like size.

The source roles include size_scale, entity, and scalar_position. The target roles include importance_scale, entity_evaluated_for_importance, and degree_of_importance.

The linguistic ties between these roles can be seen in the examples provided. For instance, the phrase ""a big part of this mission"" uses the term ""big"" (from the source role size_scale) to denote the importance of not contaminating the planet with Earth organisms (the target role entity_evaluated_for_importance). Similarly, the phrase ""Texaco is a relatively small player"" uses ""small"" (from the source role size_scale) to denote Texaco's lesser importance (the target role degree_of_importance) in the California gasoline market.

Conceptually, the metaphor operates on the premise that *larger size implies greater importance*, and *smaller size implies lesser importance*. This is a common cognitive pattern in human thought, where we often equate physical magnitude with significance or importance.

Diving deeper into the metaphor, we can extract the concepts of *comparison* and *relative importance*. Just as objects can be compared based on their size, entities can be compared based on their importance. The metaphor also implies a *scale of importance*, paralleling the physical scale used to measure size.

Furthermore, the metaphor encompasses nuances such as *perception of importance*, *context-dependent importance*, and *fluctuation in importance*. For instance, Texaco's importance varies depending on the geographical context - it's a smaller player in California but a bigger factor in the Eastern states. This mirrors how the perceived size of an object can change depending on the viewer's perspective or the comparison context.

Overall, the IMPORTANCE_IS_SIZE metaphor provides a tangible framework to understand and discuss the abstract concept of importance.";"importance; size; larger size implies greater importance; smaller size implies lesser importance; comparison; relative importance; scale of importance; perception of importance; context-dependent importance; fluctuation in importance"
98;INHIBITTING_ENACTMENT_OF_LEGISLATION_IS_IMPEDING_MOTION;Impediment_to_motion;Legislation_enactment;"mover;affected_motion";"bill;bill_status_change";"Senate Republicans blocked legislation Wednesday that would have established a billion jobs program putting veterans back to work tending to the country's federal lands and bolstering local police and fire departments ; This mini-controversy erupted when Republicans introduced a string of amendments in a final effort to obstruct passage of the reconciliation bill ";"In the metaphor INHIBITTING_ENACTMENT_OF_LEGISLATION_IS_IMPEDING_MOTION, the source frame is Impediment_to_motion and the target frame is Legislation_enactment. The metaphorical connection is drawn between the roles of the source frame (mover; affected_motion) and the target frame (bill; bill_status_change).

Conceptually, the metaphor equates the process of enacting legislation to a form of motion, and the act of inhibiting this enactment to an impediment to that motion. This metaphorical connection is based on the idea that both processes involve a progression from one state to another. In the case of motion, it is a physical movement from one location to another, while in the case of legislation enactment, it is a procedural movement from proposal to law.

Linguistically, the roles in the source frame (mover; affected_motion) are tied to the roles in the target frame (bill; bill_status_change) through the use of words that denote obstruction or hindrance. For example, in the provided examples, phrases such as ""Senate Republicans blocked legislation"" and ""obstruct passage of the reconciliation bill"" are used to describe the act of inhibiting the enactment of legislation. These phrases draw a parallel between the physical act of blocking or obstructing motion and the procedural act of inhibiting legislation enactment.

Diving deeper into the metaphor, we can extract the concepts of *resistance* and *struggle*. Just as a physical object encounters resistance or struggle when its motion is impeded, a bill faces resistance or struggle when its enactment is inhibited. This resistance can come from various sources, such as political opposition, public opinion, or legal challenges.

Moreover, the metaphor also encompasses the concept of *effort*. Just as it takes effort to overcome an impediment to motion, it takes effort to overcome the obstacles that inhibit the enactment of legislation. This effort can involve negotiation, persuasion, and compromise.

Finally, the metaphor implies a sense of *directionality*. Just as motion implies a direction from one location to another, the enactment of legislation implies a direction from proposal to law. When this direction is impeded, it can result in stagnation or a change in direction.";"resistance; struggle; effort; directionality"

This metaphorical connection suggests that institutions, like organisms, have various parts that function together, a health status that can be measured, and a need for planning and adaptation for future survival.

The source role of 'part_function' corresponds to the target role of 'position_duties'. This connection implies that just as different parts of an organism have specific functions, different positions within an institution have specific duties. This highlights the *interdependence* and *specialization* within both organisms and institutions.

The source role of 'health_status' is linked to the target role of 'functional_status'. This suggests that the health of an organism is metaphorically similar to the functional status of an institution. The 'health' of an institution is measured by its effectiveness and how well it plans for the future, much like an organism's health is determined by its overall functioning and ability to adapt to future changes. This connection emphasizes the concept of *viability* and *sustainability*.

The source role of 'organism' corresponds to the target role of 'institution_whole'. This implies that an institution, like an organism, is a whole entity made up of interdependent parts. This connection underscores the concept of *unity* and *cohesion*.

The source role of 'specialized_parts' is linked to the target role of 'positions'. This suggests that just as an organism has specialized parts for different functions, an institution has different positions with specific duties. This connection highlights the concept of *division of labor* and *specialization*.

The repeated example provided illustrates these connections. The 'health' of an institution, like that of an organism, is measured by the effectiveness of its organization (part_function/position_duties) and its ability to plan for the future (health_status/functional_status).

In this metaphor, the dynamics of a living organism are used to understand the complexities of an institution. It allows us to conceptualize institutions as living entities with *interconnected parts*, *health statuses*, and *adaptive capabilities*. This metaphor also implies that, like organisms, institutions can grow, evolve, and potentially 'die' if they fail to adapt to changing circumstances.";"interdependence; specialization; viability; sustainability; unity; cohesion; division of labor; specialization; interconnected parts; health statuses; adaptive capabilities"

The metaphorical connections between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame are as follows:

1. Factory workers in the source frame correspond to institution holders in the target frame. This connection suggests that just as factory workers are responsible for the production process in a factory, institution holders are responsible for the production of ideas, knowledge, or skills in an institution. This connection highlights the *process of production* and the *role of human agency* in both contexts.

2. The factory itself in the source frame corresponds to the institution in the target frame. This connection suggests that institutions, like factories, are structured environments where production takes place. This connection underscores the *systematic nature* and *organizational structure* of both factories and institutions.

3. Factory managers in the source frame correspond to institution heads in the target frame. This connection implies that just as factory managers oversee and control the production process in a factory, institution heads oversee and control the production of ideas, knowledge, or skills in an institution. This connection emphasizes the *role of leadership* and *management* in both contexts.

The metaphor INSTITUTION_IS_A_FACTORY is a powerful one because it captures the dynamics of institutions as places where raw materials (in this case, less productive workers or undeveloped ideas) are transformed into more valuable outputs (more productive workers or new frameworks, insights, and understanding). This metaphor also highlights the *process of transformation*, the *value of output*, and the *efficiency* of the production process in both factories and institutions.

Moreover, the metaphor suggests that institutions, like factories, can be seen as places where standardization and uniformity are valued, where inputs are processed in a systematic and efficient manner to produce desired outputs. This view of institutions may be critiqued for its potential to devalue individuality and creativity, just as factories can be critiqued for their potential to dehumanize workers. These are some of the deeper dynamics and implications of the metaphor INSTITUTION_IS_A_FACTORY.";"process of production; role of human agency; systematic nature; organizational structure; role of leadership; management; process of transformation; value of output; efficiency"

The metaphorical connections between roles in the source frame and those in the target frame can be analyzed as follows:

1. Purpose (Machine) - Mission (Institution): This connection suggests that just as a machine is designed and built for a specific purpose, an institution is established with a particular mission in mind. The purpose of a machine can be seen as a tangible, concrete goal, while the mission of an institution is often more abstract, encompassing societal or communal objectives. This connection highlights the *intentionality* and *goal-orientation* inherent in both machines and institutions.

2. Functional Status (Machine) - Functional Status (Institution): This connection implies that both machines and institutions have a functional status, indicating whether they are operating effectively or not. This draws a parallel between the *efficiency* and *performance* of machines and institutions.

3. Machine Entity (Machine) - Institution Whole (Institution): This connection suggests that just as a machine is a complete entity made up of various parts working together, an institution is a whole entity composed of different elements (like people, rules, and norms) that function in unison. This highlights the *complexity* and *interconnectedness* of both machines and institutions.

4. Operating X-Schema (Machine) - Functions (Institution): This connection implies that the way a machine operates or functions can be compared to the functions or roles an institution plays in society. This connection underscores the *activity* and *functionality* inherent in both machines and institutions.

The metaphor INSTITUTION_IS_A_MACHINE is a powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of institutions. It suggests that institutions, like machines, are complex systems designed for specific purposes, have a functional status indicating their effectiveness, and are composed of various interconnected parts. This metaphor also implies that institutions, like machines, require maintenance and care to function effectively, and that they can break down or malfunction if not properly managed. This metaphor thus provides a framework for understanding institutions in a concrete, tangible way, highlighting their *complexity*, *purposefulness*, *interconnectedness*, and *potential for dysfunction*.";"intentionality; goal-orientation; efficiency; performance; complexity; interconnectedness; activity; functionality; complexity; purposefulness; interconnectedness; potential for dysfunction"

The metaphorical connections between roles in the source frame and those in the target frame are as follows:

1. The ""relationship.relationship_whole"" in the source frame corresponds to ""international_relations"" in the target frame. This connection suggests that just as a relationship is a holistic entity that involves multiple aspects such as communication, trust, and mutual understanding, international relations too are complex and multifaceted, encompassing diplomacy, trade, conflict, and cooperation.

2. The ""relationship.related_entity2"" and ""relationship.related_entity_1"" in the source frame correspond to ""international_relations.nation2"" and ""international_relation.nation1"" in the target frame respectively. This connection implies that just as two individuals are the key entities in a relationship, two nations are the primary entities in international relations.

The metaphorical connection between these roles highlights the linguistic and conceptual ties. Linguistically, the terms used in the source frame (relationship, related entities) and the target frame (international relations, nations) are analogous, indicating a metaphorical mapping from interpersonal relationships to international relations. Conceptually, the dynamics of interpersonal relationships, such as mutual understanding, cooperation, conflict, and negotiation, are applied to understand the dynamics of international relations.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the concept of *interdependence* and *reciprocity*. Just as in a relationship, where actions of one individual affect the other, in international relations, actions of one nation impact the other. This metaphor also suggests *mutual influence* and *negotiation*, as in a relationship, decisions are often made through negotiation and compromise, and so are international relations often shaped by negotiations between nations.

The metaphor also implies the concept of *emotional attachment* and *alliances*. The example ""Which country is your country's best friend"" suggests that nations, like individuals, can have 'friends' or allies that they share a close and positive relationship with. This reflects the dynamics of interpersonal relationships where individuals have best friends or close allies.

In conclusion, the metaphor INTERNATIONAL_RELATIONS_ARE_INTERPERSONAL_RELATIONSHIPS allows us to understand the complex dynamics of international relations by drawing parallels with the more familiar and intuitive dynamics of interpersonal relationships.";"interdependence; reciprocity; mutual influence; negotiation; emotional attachment; alliances"

The roles in the source frame are perceived_thing, faculty, perception_x-schema, and perceiver, while the roles in the target frame are knowledge, mind, knowing_x-schema, and knower.

The metaphorical connections between the roles in the source and target frames are as follows:

1. The perceived_thing in the source frame corresponds to knowledge in the target frame. This suggests that knowledge, like a perceived thing, is something that can be sensed or experienced. It is not just an abstract concept, but something tangible that can be ""seen"", ""heard"", or ""felt"". This connection highlights the *tangibility* of knowledge.

2. The faculty in the source frame corresponds to the mind in the target frame. This implies that the mind, like our sensory faculties, is a tool or mechanism for perceiving and understanding the world. This connection underscores the *instrumentality* of the mind in the process of knowing.

3. The perception_x-schema in the source frame corresponds to the knowing_x-schema in the target frame. This suggests that the process of knowing, like the process of perceiving, involves a sequence of steps or stages. This connection emphasizes the *procedural nature* of knowing.

4. The perceiver in the source frame corresponds to the knower in the target frame. This implies that the knower, like the perceiver, is an active participant in the process of knowing, not a passive recipient of information. This connection highlights the *agency* of the knower.

The examples provided further illustrate these metaphorical connections. For instance, ""I see what you mean"" uses visual perception as a metaphor for understanding, while ""Something doesn't smell quite right here"" uses olfactory perception as a metaphor for suspicion or doubt. ""Listen to what your father tells you"" uses auditory perception as a metaphor for learning, and ""I have no idea what my friends are doing they've kept me completely in the dark"" uses the absence of light (and thus visual perception) as a metaphor for ignorance or lack of knowledge.

These examples show how the metaphor KNOWING_IS_PERCEIVING linguistically and conceptually ties the roles in the source and target frames. They also reveal the underlying dynamics of the metaphor, such as the *active engagement* in the process of knowing, the *sequential nature* of this process, and the *tangible and sensory aspects* of knowledge.";"tangibility; instrumentality; procedural nature; agency; active engagement; sequential nature; tangible and sensory aspects"
104;KNOWING_IS_SEEING;Seeing;Knowing;"eyes;seer;seen_object;visual_ability";"mind;knower;knowledge;knowledge_capacity";I see what you mean;"In the metaphor KNOWING_IS_SEEING, the source frame is ""Seeing"" and the target frame is ""Knowing"". The roles in the source frame are 'eyes', 'seer', 'seen_object', and 'visual_ability', while the roles in the target frame are 'mind', 'knower', 'knowledge', and 'knowledge_capacity'.

The metaphorical connections between these roles can be analyzed as follows:

1. 'Eyes' in the source frame corresponds to 'mind' in the target frame. This suggests that just as our eyes are the primary tools for seeing, our mind is the primary tool for knowing. This connection implies the concept of *perception*, where the mind is seen as the organ of perception for knowledge, similar to how eyes perceive visual information.

2. 'Seer' in the source frame corresponds to 'knower' in the target frame. This implies that the person who sees (seer) is analogous to the person who knows (knower). This connection highlights the *agency* in both seeing and knowing, suggesting that both processes are active and require a subject who performs the action.

3. 'Seen_object' in the source frame corresponds to 'knowledge' in the target frame. This suggests that the object that is seen is metaphorically similar to the knowledge that is known. This connection implies the concept of *objectivity*, suggesting that knowledge, like a seen object, exists independently of the knower and can be perceived and understood.

4. 'Visual_ability' in the source frame corresponds to 'knowledge_capacity' in the target frame. This suggests that the ability to see is metaphorically similar to the capacity to know. This connection implies the concept of *potential*, indicating that just as visual ability determines what we can see, our knowledge capacity determines what we can know.

The example ""I see what you mean"" from Philosophy in the Flesh illustrates this metaphor. Here, ""seeing"" is used metaphorically to mean ""understanding"" or ""knowing"", reinforcing the connection between the roles in the source and target frames.

This metaphor also encompasses deeper concepts such as *clarity* and *visibility*. In seeing, clarity and visibility are crucial for accurate perception. Similarly, in knowing, clear understanding and visibility of information are essential for accurate knowledge. This metaphor thus suggests that knowledge is not just about acquiring information, but also about 'seeing' it clearly and 'visually' comprehending its meaning.";"perception; agency; objectivity; potential; clarity; visibility"
105;KNOWING_IS_TOUCHING;Touching;Knowing;"touching_x-schema;limbs;object;toucher";"knowing_x-schema;mind;idea;knower";"I've almost got an idea but I can't quite put my finger on it ; I could never put my finger on what the problem was I felt crazy at times and there were so many times that I would approach him with a very well-thought out";"In the metaphor KNOWING_IS_TOUCHING, the source frame is ""Touching"" and the target frame is ""Knowing"". The roles in the source frame are touching_x-schema, limbs, object, and toucher, which correspond to knowing_x-schema, mind, idea, and knower in the target frame.

The metaphorical connections between the roles in the source and target frames are as follows:

1. *touching_x-schema* corresponds to *knowing_x-schema*. This connection suggests that the process of touching, which involves physical contact and sensory perception, is metaphorically similar to the process of knowing, which involves mental comprehension and understanding. Both processes involve an interaction between an agent and an object, resulting in a change in the agent's state - physical sensation in the case of touching, and mental awareness in the case of knowing.

2. *limbs* corresponds to *mind*. This connection implies that just as limbs are the physical tools we use to touch and interact with the world, the mind is the cognitive tool we use to know and understand the world. Both are essential instruments that enable the respective processes.

3. *object* corresponds to *idea*. This connection suggests that just as an object is what is physically touched, an idea is what is mentally known. Both are the targets or subjects of the respective processes.

4. *toucher* corresponds to *knower*. This connection implies that just as a toucher is the one who performs the act of touching, a knower is the one who performs the act of knowing. Both are the agents or initiators of the respective processes.

The example provided, ""I've almost got an idea but I can't quite put my finger on it"", illustrates these metaphorical connections. The phrase ""put my finger on it"" is a linguistic manifestation of the KNOWING_IS_TOUCHING metaphor, where the act of touching (putting one's finger on something) is used to represent the act of knowing or understanding an idea. This phrase also highlights the conceptual ties between the roles in the source and target frames, as it involves a *knower* (the speaker) using their *mind* (metaphorically their finger) to try to understand an *idea* (metaphorically an object) through the process of *knowing* (metaphorically touching).

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the *transformation* of physical sensory experiences into abstract cognitive processes, and the *internalization* of external objects (ideas) into internal states (knowledge). This metaphor also encompasses nuances such as the *difficulty & uncertainty* in knowing (paralleling the difficulty in physically locating or identifying an object by touch alone), and the *precision & clarity* that comes with successful knowing (paralleling the clear sensory feedback when one successfully touches an object).";"touching_x-schema; knowing_x-schema; limbs; mind; object; idea; toucher; knower; knower; mind; idea; knowing; transformation; internalization; difficulty & uncertainty; precision & clarity"
106;LAWS_ARE_PHYSICAL_STRUCTURES;Physical_structure;Law;"structure_creator;structure_whole";"law_creator;law";dismantle gun laws;"In the metaphor LAWS_ARE_PHYSICAL_STRUCTURES, the source frame is Physical_structure and the target frame is Law. The roles in the source frame, structure_creator and structure_whole, are metaphorically connected to the roles in the target frame, law_creator and law respectively.

The *structure_creator* in the source frame can be seen as the architect or builder of a physical structure. This role is metaphorically connected to the *law_creator* in the target frame, who is the legislator or policymaker that constructs the law. This connection implies that just as a structure_creator designs and builds a physical structure with a specific purpose and function in mind, a law_creator designs and constructs a law to serve a specific societal purpose or function.

The *structure_whole* in the source frame refers to the entire physical structure, which is metaphorically connected to the *law* in the target frame. This connection suggests that just as a physical structure is a tangible, solid entity that provides a framework and imposes certain constraints on its occupants, a law is an intangible, yet solid entity that provides a societal framework and imposes certain constraints on its subjects.

The example ""dismantle gun laws"" further illustrates this metaphor. The verb ""dismantle"" is typically used in the context of physical structures, implying a process of taking apart or deconstructing. When applied to laws, it suggests a process of deconstructing or removing the law, similar to how a physical structure might be dismantled.

This metaphor thus encapsulates the concepts of *creation*, *structure*, and *deconstruction*. The *creation* aspect highlights the deliberate and purposeful act of constructing both physical structures and laws. The *structure* aspect emphasizes the role of both physical structures and laws as frameworks that guide and constrain behavior. The *deconstruction* aspect underscores the possibility of dismantling or removing both physical structures and laws when they no longer serve their intended purpose.

Furthermore, this metaphor also implies the concepts of *stability* and *change*. Just as physical structures provide stability but can be changed or dismantled, laws provide societal stability but can also be changed or dismantled.";"structure_creator; law_creator; structure_whole; law; creation; structure; deconstruction; creation; structure; deconstruction; stability; change"
107;LAWS_ARE_PLANTS;Plants;Law;"plant_nourishment;plant_size;plant_entity;plant_attributes";"law_creator;jurisdiction;law;legal_actions";Out of these discussions will grow legislation of farreaching importance;"In the metaphor LAWS_ARE_PLANTS, the source frame is Plants and the target frame is Law. The roles in the source frame, such as plant_nourishment, plant_size, plant_entity, and plant_attributes, are metaphorically linked to the roles in the target frame, such as law_creator, jurisdiction, law, and legal_actions.

The metaphorical connection between the roles can be understood as follows:

1. *Plant_nourishment* is linked to *law_creator*. Just as plants require nourishment to grow and thrive, laws require creators who nourish them with ideas, discussions, and debates. This nourishment is essential for the law to be formed and to function effectively. The concept of *nourishment* here implies the *nurturing and development* of laws by their creators.

2. *Plant_size* is metaphorically connected to *jurisdiction*. The size of a plant can be seen as a metaphor for the jurisdiction of a law. The larger the plant, the more space it covers, just as a law with a larger jurisdiction has a wider reach. This connection highlights the concept of *scope and influence*.

3. *Plant_entity* is linked to *law*. A plant as an entity grows from a seed, matures, and eventually dies, which can be seen as a metaphor for the life cycle of a law. A law is proposed, enacted, enforced, and sometimes repealed. This metaphorical connection underscores the concept of *growth and evolution*.

4. *Plant_attributes* is connected to *legal_actions*. The attributes of a plant, such as its ability to provide shade or bear fruit, can be seen as a metaphor for the actions that a law can enable or prevent. This connection emphasizes the concept of *functionality and impact*.

The example given, ""Out of these discussions will grow legislation of farreaching importance,"" illustrates the metaphorical connection between the growth of a plant and the creation of a law. The discussions are the *nourishment* that allows the legislation (the *plant*) to grow and have far-reaching importance (the *size* and *attributes*).

In this metaphor, laws are not static, but dynamic and organic entities, much like plants. They require care and attention (nourishment), have a certain scope (size), exist and evolve (entity), and have specific functions and impacts (attributes). This metaphor thus encapsulates the *dynamics of law creation and enforcement*, the *organic and evolving nature of laws*, and their *far-reaching impacts*.";"Plant_nourishment; law_creator; nourishment; nurturing and development; Plant_size; jurisdiction; scope and influence; Plant_entity; law; growth and evolution; Plant_attributes; legal_actions; functionality and impact; nourishment; plant; size; attributes; dynamics of law creation and enforcement; organic and evolving nature of laws; far-reaching impacts"

The metaphorical connections between roles in the source frame and those in the target frame are as follows:

- The vehicle_drivers in the source frame correspond to nation_leaders in the target frame. This connection implies that just as drivers control the direction and speed of a vehicle, leaders control the direction and progress of a nation. This connection highlights the *responsibility* and *control* that leaders have over a nation, similar to drivers with a vehicle.

- The vehicle in the source frame corresponds to the nation_whole in the target frame. This suggests that the nation, like a vehicle, is a single entity that moves and functions as a unit. This connection underscores the concept of *unity* and *collective movement*.

- The vehicle_passengers in the source frame correspond to nation_citizens in the target frame. This implies that citizens, like passengers, are affected by the direction and speed of the nation, but do not directly control it. This connection highlights the *dependency* of citizens on the decisions and actions of their leaders.

The examples provided further illustrate these connections. For instance, ""The president drove the nation into a ditch"" and ""Obama on GOP: 'They Drove The Country Into A DitchNow They Want The Keys Back'"" use the metaphor to criticize leaders for leading the nation into difficult situations, just as a bad driver might drive a vehicle into a ditch. Similarly, ""Where was he when he drove our country off a cliff"" uses the metaphor to question a leader's decision-making at a critical time, just as one might question a driver's actions leading to a crash.

This metaphor also implies certain dynamics and nuances. For example, it suggests that *good leadership* is akin to *good driving*, requiring skills such as foresight, judgment, and the ability to navigate obstacles. It also implies that, like a vehicle, a nation can be *damaged* or *derailed* by poor leadership. Furthermore, it suggests that citizens, like passengers, are *vulnerable* to the actions of their leaders and can suffer consequences from poor leadership.";"responsibility; control; unity; collective movement; dependency; good leadership; good driving; damaged; derailed; vulnerable"

I got a much better idea of what was going on after the last meeting ; She had acquired an intimate knowledge of the terrain which now helped her to travel quickly ; Her experience gave her a great deal of knowledge";"In the metaphor LEARNING_IS_ACQUIRING, the source frame is Gain_possession and the target frame is Learning. The metaphorical connections between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame are as follows:

- The source role of 'possession' corresponds to the target role of 'learned_material'. This connection suggests that the knowledge or skills learned are metaphorically viewed as possessions that one acquires. This implies a sense of *ownership* over the learned material, similar to how one owns a physical possession.

- The source role of 'recipient' is linked to the target role of 'learner'. This connection implies that the learner, like a recipient, is the one who receives or acquires the learned material. This highlights the *active role* of the learner in the learning process, similar to the active role of a recipient in acquiring a possession.

- The source role of 'getting_x-schema' corresponds to the target role of 'learning_x-schema'. This connection suggests that the process of learning is metaphorically viewed as a process of acquiring or getting. This implies a *transformation* from not knowing to knowing, similar to the transformation from not possessing to possessing.

The examples provided further illustrate these metaphorical connections. For instance, ""She had acquired an intimate knowledge of the terrain"" and ""Her experience gave her a great deal of knowledge"" both use language associated with acquisition to describe the process of learning.

In this metaphor, the underlying dynamics involve the conceptualization of learning as a process of acquisition. This involves *internalization* of the learned material, similar to how a possession becomes part of one's belongings. It also involves a sense of *achievement* or *gain*, as acquiring a possession often implies a positive outcome.

Furthermore, the metaphor encompasses nuances such as *quality of learning*, paralleled with the quality of the possession, and *effort & perseverance*, paralleled with the effort needed to acquire a possession. The metaphor also suggests a *progressive nature* of learning, as acquiring often involves a process or a journey, not an instantaneous event.";"ownership; active role; transformation; internalization; achievement; gain; quality of learning; effort & perseverance; progressive nature"

This metaphorical mapping establishes a conceptual link between the elements of a journey and the stages or aspects of life.

The source role ""journeyer"" is metaphorically connected to the target role ""life_liver"". This suggests that the person living their life is seen as a traveler on a journey. The journeyer's experiences, choices, and actions are paralleled with the life_liver's experiences, decisions, and actions in life. This connection implies a sense of *agency* and *autonomy*, as the journeyer/life_liver has the power to decide their path and destination.

The source role ""journey_companion"" is linked to the target role ""life_companion"". This connection implies that just as we have companions on a journey, we also have companions in life. These could be friends, family, or partners who accompany us, provide support, and share experiences. This highlights the *social aspect* of life and the importance of *relationships*.

The source role ""journey_destination"" corresponds to the target role ""main_life_goal"". This suggests that the end goal or destination of a journey is metaphorically similar to the main goal or purpose in life. This connection emphasizes the concept of *purpose* and *direction* in life.

The source role ""journey_difficulties"" is connected to the target role ""life_difficulties"". This implies that the challenges encountered on a journey are metaphorically similar to the difficulties faced in life. This connection underscores the concept of *struggle* and *overcoming obstacles*.

The source role ""vehicles_in_journey"" is linked to the target role ""relationships_in_life"". This suggests that relationships in life are seen as vehicles that can help us move forward on our journey, emphasizing the *instrumental role* of relationships.

The source role ""journey_event"" corresponds to the target role ""life_span"". This connection implies that the events that occur during a journey are metaphorically similar to the span of a person's life, emphasizing the *temporal aspect* of life.

The source role ""path_traced_by_sequence_of_motion"" is linked to the target role ""course_of_life"". This suggests that the path taken on a journey is metaphorically similar to the course of a person's life, emphasizing the concept of *life trajectory*.

The source role ""manner_of_journey"" corresponds to the target role ""lifestyle"". This implies that the way one travels on a journey is metaphorically similar to one's lifestyle, emphasizing the concept of *personal choices* and *values*.

The source role ""journey_stops"" is connected to the target role ""short_term_life_goals"". This suggests that the stops or milestones on a journey are metaphorically similar to short-term goals in life, emphasizing the concept of *progress* and *achievement*.

Finally, the source role ""locations_along_journey"" is linked to the target role ""life_stages"". This implies that the different locations visited on a journey are metaphorically similar to the different stages of life, emphasizing the concept of *change* and *development*.

Overall, the LIFE_IS_A_JOURNEY metaphor provides a rich conceptual framework for understanding life, emphasizing concepts such as *agency*, *relationships*, *purpose*, *struggle*, *progress*, and *change*.";"agency; autonomy; social aspect; relationships; purpose; direction; struggle; overcoming obstacles; instrumental role; temporal aspect; life trajectory; personal choices; values; progress; achievement; change; development; agency; relationships; purpose; struggle; progress; change"
111;MACHINES_ARE_PEOPLE;Person;Machine;"health_of_person;human_body;person;human_mind";"good_functioning_of_machine;machine_hardware;machine;machine_software";The engine is dying we need to repair it;"In the metaphor MACHINES_ARE_PEOPLE, the source frame is Person and the target frame is Machine. The metaphorical connections between roles in the source frame and those in the target frame are as follows:

1. The health of a person is metaphorically linked to the good functioning of a machine. Just as a person's health determines their ability to function effectively, the good functioning of a machine determines its efficiency and productivity. This connection highlights the conceptual tie of *maintenance and care* for both humans and machines to ensure their optimal performance.

2. The human body is metaphorically connected to the machine hardware. This connection is based on the idea that both the human body and machine hardware are physical entities that house the necessary components for functioning. This connection underscores the conceptual tie of *physical structure and integrity*.

3. The person role is metaphorically linked to the machine role. This connection suggests that machines, like people, have a purpose or function to fulfill. This connection emphasizes the conceptual tie of *purpose and functionality*.

4. The human mind is metaphorically connected to the machine software. Just as the human mind controls the actions and responses of a person, the machine software controls the operations of a machine. This connection highlights the conceptual tie of *control and direction*.

The example ""The engine is dying we need to repair it"" illustrates these metaphorical connections. The phrase ""The engine is dying"" is a metaphorical expression that likens the failing engine (machine) to a sick or dying person. The need to ""repair it"" parallels the human need for medical intervention when health is compromised. This metaphor encapsulates the concepts of *vulnerability and resilience*, *intervention and repair*, and *life-cycle and durability*.

In this metaphor, machines are personified, and their maintenance and repair are likened to human healthcare. This metaphor not only helps in understanding machines in a more intuitive way but also emphasizes the importance of regular maintenance and timely repair in ensuring the longevity and efficiency of machines, similar to the care and attention required for human health.";"maintenance and care; physical structure and integrity; purpose and functionality; control and direction; vulnerability and resilience; intervention and repair; life-cycle and durability"

This metaphor is based on the conceptual mapping of the source frame, which is ""Bodily_functioning"", onto the target frame, which is ""Cognizing"". The roles in the source frame are ""body_whole"", ""body_structure"", and ""bodily_capacity"", while the roles in the target frame are ""mind_whole"", ""mind_structure"", and ""mental_capacity"".

The metaphorical connections between the roles in the source and target frames can be analyzed as follows:

1. ""body_whole"" to ""mind_whole"": This connection suggests that just as the body is a complete entity with various interconnected parts and systems, the mind is also a complete entity with various interconnected cognitive processes and structures. This implies a concept of *wholeness* and *interconnectedness* in both the body and the mind.

2. ""body_structure"" to ""mind_structure"": This connection implies that just as the body has a specific structure with different parts performing different functions, the mind also has a structure with different cognitive processes performing different functions. This suggests a concept of *functional differentiation* within both the body and the mind.

3. ""bodily_capacity"" to ""mental_capacity"": This connection suggests that just as the body has a certain capacity or potential for performing physical tasks, the mind has a certain capacity or potential for performing cognitive tasks. This implies a concept of *potential* and *capability* in both the body and the mind.

The example provided, ""Do the exercises at the end of this chapter"", does not seem to directly illustrate the metaphorical connections. However, if we consider ""exercises"" as a metaphor for cognitive tasks, it could be seen as a call to use one's mental capacity, similar to how one would use their bodily capacity to perform physical exercises.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the comparison of abstract cognitive processes to more concrete bodily functions. This comparison not only makes the abstract processes more understandable, but also highlights the complexity and intricacy of these processes. It also suggests that just as the body can be trained and improved through exercise, the mind can also be trained and improved through cognitive tasks, implying a concept of *growth* and *development* in both the body and the mind.";"wholeness; interconnectedness; functional differentiation; potential; capability; growth; development"
113;MONEY_IS_A_LIQUID;Liquid;Money;liquid;money;"The money is all dried up ; Liquid assets ; Currency ; He's just sponging off of you";"In the metaphor MONEY_IS_A_LIQUID, the source frame is Liquid and the target frame is Money. The source role is liquid and the target role is money. This metaphorical connection implies that money, like liquid, can flow, be contained, evaporate, or be absorbed.

The first conceptual tie is the idea of *flow*. Just as liquid flows from one place to another, money is also transferred or exchanged between individuals, businesses, or countries. This is evident in the example ""Currency"", which refers to the system of money in general use in a particular country.

The second conceptual tie is the idea of *containment*. Just as liquid can be held in a container, money can also be stored or saved. This is reflected in the example ""Liquid assets"", which refers to assets that can be quickly converted into cash.

The third conceptual tie is the idea of *evaporation*. Just as liquid can evaporate and disappear, money can also be used up or lost. This is evident in the example ""The money is all dried up"", which implies that all the money has been spent or wasted.

The fourth conceptual tie is the idea of *absorption*. Just as a sponge absorbs liquid, people can also take or absorb money from others. This is reflected in the example ""He's just sponging off of you"", which implies that someone is taking advantage of you financially.

These metaphorical connections highlight the dynamic and fluid nature of money. They also reveal underlying dynamics such as *economic exchange & circulation*, *financial security & liquidity*, *financial loss & scarcity*, and *financial exploitation & dependency*. These abstract processes can be compared to physical processes, but they also encompass nuances such as *economic fluidity paralleled with liquid flow*, *financial stability paralleled with liquid containment*, *financial crisis paralleled with liquid evaporation*, and *financial parasitism paralleled with liquid absorption*.";"flow; containment; evaporation; absorption; economic exchange & circulation; financial security & liquidity; financial loss & scarcity; financial exploitation & dependency; economic fluidity paralleled with liquid flow; financial stability paralleled with liquid containment; financial crisis paralleled with liquid evaporation; financial parasitism paralleled with liquid absorption"
114;MONEY_TRANSFER_IS_FLUID_MOTION;Fluid_motion;Money;fluid;money;"cash flow ; The money is gushing out of my retirement account";"In the metaphor MONEY_TRANSFER_IS_FLUID_MOTION, the source frame is Fluid_motion and the target frame is Money. The source role is fluid and the target role is money. This metaphorical connection is based on the conceptualization of money transfer as a fluid motion, which is a common way of understanding and describing financial transactions.

The key concept in this metaphor is the *movement* of money, which is compared to the *flow* of a fluid. Just as fluid moves from one place to another, money is transferred from one account or person to another. This movement is not static but dynamic, and it can vary in speed and volume, just like the flow of a fluid.

The examples provided, ""cash flow"" and ""The money is gushing out of my retirement account,"" further illustrate this metaphorical connection. The term ""cash flow"" directly invokes the image of money moving like a fluid, while the phrase ""The money is gushing out"" uses the verb ""gushing,"" which is typically associated with the rapid and forceful flow of a fluid, to describe the fast and uncontrollable outflow of money.

In addition to the concept of *movement*, this metaphor also implies other related concepts such as *control* and *direction*. Just as we can control the flow of a fluid by using valves or dams, we can control the flow of money by using various financial tools and strategies. Similarly, just as a fluid can flow in a certain direction, money can be directed towards certain investments or expenses.

Moreover, the metaphor also suggests the concept of *volume*. Just as the flow of a fluid can be large or small, the flow of money can also be large or small. This is reflected in the phrase ""The money is gushing out,"" which suggests a large volume of money being transferred.

In conclusion, the metaphor MONEY_TRANSFER_IS_FLUID_MOTION conceptualizes money transfer as a fluid motion, highlighting the dynamic nature of financial transactions and implying related concepts such as *movement*, *control*, *direction*, and *volume*.";"movement; flow; movement; control; direction; volume; movement; control; direction; volume"
115;MORALITY_IS_A_STRAIGHT_PATH;Straight_path;Morality;person_moving_along_straight_line;moral_person;"He is a deviant ; He deviated from the straight and narrow ; She strayed";"In the metaphor MORALITY_IS_A_STRAIGHT_PATH, the source frame is a Straight_path, and the target frame is Morality. The source role is a person moving along a straight line, and the target role is a moral person. The metaphorical connections between these roles are both linguistic and conceptual.

Linguistically, the metaphor uses terms related to physical movement along a path to describe moral behavior. For instance, the words ""deviant"", ""deviated"", and ""strayed"" are all used to describe someone who has moved away from a straight path, and by extension, someone who has acted immorally.

Conceptually, the metaphor equates *moral behavior* with *staying on a straight path*. This implies that morality is a journey with a clear, unambiguous direction. Just as a person moving along a straight line has a clear path to follow, a moral person has a clear set of principles to adhere to. This concept also suggests that any deviation from this pathany immoral actis a conscious choice, just as a person must consciously decide to leave a straight path.

The metaphor also implies a sense of *discipline* and *self-control*. Staying on a straight path requires a certain level of discipline, just as adhering to moral principles requires self-control. This connection between physical discipline and moral discipline further strengthens the metaphor.

Moreover, the metaphor suggests that morality, like a straight path, is *objective* and *universal*. Just as a straight path is the same for everyone, moral principles are the same for everyone. This concept implies a certain level of *moral absolutism*, the belief that there are universal moral principles that everyone should follow.

Finally, the metaphor implies that moral behavior, like following a straight path, leads to a *positive outcome*. Just as a person who stays on a straight path will reach their destination, a person who adheres to moral principles will achieve a good life. This concept suggests a connection between *moral behavior* and *personal fulfillment*.

In conclusion, the metaphor MORALITY_IS_A_STRAIGHT_PATH uses physical movement along a path as a metaphor for moral behavior, implying concepts of discipline, self-control, moral absolutism, and personal fulfillment.";"moral behavior; staying on a straight path; discipline; self-control; objective; universal; moral absolutism; positive outcome; moral behavior; personal fulfillment"
116;MORALITY_IS_PURITY;Purity;Morality;"pure_entity;pure_condition";"moral_entity;moral_condition";He's pure of heart and therefore would never hurt someone;"In the metaphor MORALITY_IS_PURITY, the source frame is Purity and the target frame is Morality. The roles in the source frame are pure_entity and pure_condition, which correspond to the roles in the target frame of moral_entity and moral_condition.

The metaphorical connection between these roles is that the state of being pure (pure_condition) is conceptually linked to the state of being moral (moral_condition). Similarly, a pure entity (pure_entity) is metaphorically connected to a moral entity (moral_entity). This metaphor suggests that morality, like purity, involves a state of being free from contamination, corruption, or wrongdoing.

The example ""He's pure of heart and therefore would never hurt someone"" illustrates this metaphorical connection. Here, the phrase ""pure of heart"" linguistically represents the source role of pure_condition, and it is conceptually tied to the target role of moral_condition. The implication is that because this person is pure (free from contamination or corruption), he would never commit a harmful act, which is a moral condition.

This metaphor also implies several key concepts. One is the idea of *integrity*, which is inherent in both purity and morality. Just as a pure substance is undiluted and unadulterated, a person with moral integrity is honest and upright, without deceit or wrongdoing. Another key concept is *innocence*, which is often associated with purity and is also a quality of a moral person who does no harm.

The metaphor also suggests a concept of *transformation* or *maintenance*. Just as purity can be lost through contamination, morality can be compromised through immoral acts. Therefore, maintaining purity or morality requires constant vigilance and effort.

Finally, this metaphor implies a concept of *judgment*. Just as purity can be assessed (for example, by testing a substance for contaminants), morality is often judged based on a person's actions and behavior. This judgment can result in social approval or disapproval, rewards or punishments, thus linking the metaphor to broader social and cultural norms and values.";"integrity; innocence; transformation; maintenance; judgment"
117;MORALITY_IS_STRAIGHTNESS;Straightness;Morality;"straight_object;property_of_being_straight";"moral_person;morality";"Be straight with me and ; He's a crooked businessman";"In the metaphor MORALITY_IS_STRAIGHTNESS, the source frame is Straightness and the target frame is Morality. The source role is the straight_object or property_of_being_straight, and the target role is the moral_person or morality.

The metaphorical connection between these roles is that *straightness* in physical objects is being used to represent *morality* in a person. This metaphor is based on the conceptual link between the physical property of straightness and the abstract concept of morality.

Straightness is a physical property that is easy to perceive and understand. It implies *directness*, *honesty*, and *consistency*. When an object is straight, it does not deviate from its path; it does not twist or turn. This physical property is metaphorically extended to the concept of morality. A moral person, like a straight object, does not deviate from the path of righteousness. They are honest, consistent, and direct in their actions.

The linguistic ties between these roles are evident in phrases like ""Be straight with me"" and ""He's a crooked businessman"". In these examples, 'straight' and 'crooked' are used metaphorically to describe moral behavior. Being 'straight' with someone means being honest and direct, while a 'crooked' businessman is dishonest and corrupt.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the *transformation* of physical properties into abstract moral qualities. Just as a straight object is *unwavering* and *consistent*, a moral person is expected to be unwavering in their commitment to honesty and consistency. This metaphor also implies a *binary opposition* between straightness (morality) and crookedness (immorality), reinforcing the idea that morality is a clear-cut, unambiguous concept.

In addition, the metaphor also encompasses nuances such as *direction & path*, *deviation & corruption*, and *consistency paralleled with integrity*.";"straightness; morality; directness; honesty; consistency; transformation; unwavering; consistent; binary opposition; direction & path; deviation & corruption; consistency paralleled with integrity"

The source role of 'parent' is metaphorically linked to the target role of 'moral_actor'. This metaphorical connection is based on the conceptual understanding of a parent as a nurturing, caring figure who guides and supports their children, and this is transferred to the moral actor who is seen as a guiding, nurturing figure in the moral sphere.

The examples provided further illustrate this metaphorical connection. The government, the CEO, and the pastor are all depicted as moral actors who take on the role of a nurturing parent. They are seen as taking care of their people, employees, and congregation respectively, much like a parent would care for their children.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the concepts of *guidance*, *nurturing*, and *responsibility*. Just as a parent guides their child, teaching them right from wrong, a moral actor guides others in moral action. The nurturing aspect is seen in the care and attention that the moral actor gives to those under their influence, mirroring the nurturing role of a parent. The concept of responsibility is also key here, as a parent has a responsibility to their child, so too does a moral actor have a responsibility to those they guide.

Furthermore, the metaphor also implies a *relationship of dependence* and *trust*, similar to the parent-child relationship. The people, employees, and congregation depend on the government, CEO, and pastor respectively, for moral guidance and support, and trust them to act in their best interests.

The metaphor also encompasses the concept of *growth* and *development*. Just as a parent's nurturing leads to the growth and development of a child, the moral actor's guidance and care leads to the moral growth and development of those under their influence. This is particularly evident in the example of the pastor's congregation flourishing under his gentle care and attention.

In conclusion, the metaphor MORAL_AGENTS_ARE_NURTURING_PARENTS draws a deep and complex connection between the roles of parents and moral actors, encompassing concepts of guidance, nurturing, responsibility, dependence, trust, and growth.";"guidance; nurturing; responsibility; relationship of dependence; trust; growth; development"
119;MORAL_IS_STRAIGHT;Straightness;Morality;straight_person;moral_person;"Be straight with me ; God-fearing men must keep strictly to the straight and narrow";"The metaphor MORAL_IS_STRAIGHT is based on the source frame of Straightness and the target frame of Morality. The roles in the source frame, such as the straight_person, are metaphorically connected to the roles in the target frame, such as the moral_person.

Conceptually, the metaphor draws on the physical attribute of *straightness* and applies it to the abstract domain of *morality*. The straightness in this context can be seen as a symbol for *directness*, *honesty*, and *consistency*, which are all considered virtues in the moral realm. In the physical world, a straight path is often the shortest and most efficient route between two points. This concept is transferred to the moral domain, where being 'straight' implies following a path that is devoid of deceit, deviation, or wrongdoing.

Linguistically, the phrase 'Be straight with me' is a request for honesty and transparency, while 'God-fearing men must keep strictly to the straight and narrow' implies a moral obligation to adhere to a path of righteousness and virtue. The word 'straight' in both examples serves as a metaphorical link between the physical attribute of straightness and the moral qualities of honesty, integrity, and righteousness.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the comparison of the physical world with the moral domain. The metaphor suggests that just as a straight path in the physical world is the most direct and efficient route, a 'straight' path in the moral realmcharacterized by honesty, integrity, and adherence to moral principlesis the most commendable and virtuous way to live. This metaphor also implies that deviation from this 'straight' path is associated with immorality or wrongdoing.

Key concepts in this metaphor include *directness*, *consistency*, and *honesty* in the source frame, and *morality*, *virtue*, and *righteousness* in the target frame. The metaphor also carries an implicit assumption that the 'straight' path is not only the most virtuous but also the most desirable and rewarding, reflecting societal values and norms.";"straightness; morality; directness; honesty; consistency; directness; consistency; honesty; morality; virtue; righteousness"

The metaphorical connections between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame are as follows:

1. The *building framework* in the source frame corresponds to the *nation infrastructure* in the target frame. This connection implies that just as a building's framework provides the basic structure and shape, a nation's infrastructure (roads, bridges, utilities, etc.) forms the basic physical structure that supports the functioning of the nation. This connection highlights the concept of *support* and *structure*.

2. The *building whole* in the source frame corresponds to the *nation whole* in the target frame. This connection suggests that a building, in its entirety, is analogous to the complete entity of a nation. This connection underscores the concept of *wholeness* and *unity*.

3. The *building integrity* in the source frame corresponds to the *state of the nation* in the target frame. This connection implies that just as the integrity of a building refers to its soundness and stability, the state of the nation refers to its overall health, stability, and functionality. This connection highlights the concept of *stability* and *health*.

4. The *building foundation* in the source frame corresponds to the *basis of continued existence* in the target frame. This connection suggests that just as a building's foundation is essential for its continued existence and stability, the fundamental principles and values (like democracy, justice, etc.) form the basis for a nation's continued existence. This connection underscores the concept of *fundamental principles* and *sustainability*.

5. The *building inhabitants* in the source frame corresponds to the *nation citizens* in the target frame. This connection implies that just as inhabitants give life to a building, citizens are the lifeblood of a nation. This connection highlights the concept of *life* and *vitality*.

The metaphor NATION_IS_A_BUILDING is a powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of a nation. It allows us to conceptualize abstract concepts like national unity, stability, and sustainability in more concrete terms. It also underscores the importance of each citizen in the life and vitality of the nation, just as each inhabitant is crucial to a building.";"building framework; nation infrastructure; support; structure; building whole; nation whole; wholeness; unity; building integrity; state of the nation; stability; health; building foundation; basis of continued existence; fundamental principles; sustainability; building inhabitants; nation citizens; life; vitality"

This nation is great because we built it togethe";"In the metaphor NATION_IS_A_COMPLEX_STRUCTURE, the nation is conceptualized as a complex physical object. This metaphorical mapping establishes a connection between the roles in the source frame (Complex_physical_object) and those in the target frame (Nation).

The source role of 'object_whole' corresponds to the target role of 'nation_whole'. This suggests that a nation, like a complex physical object, is perceived as a unified entity, a whole that is more than the sum of its parts. This connection is reflected in the phrase ""No one built this country on their own. This nation is great because we built it together."" Here, the nation is metaphorically constructed as a complex structure that requires collective effort to build and maintain.

The source role of 'object_location' is linked to the target role of 'nation_geographic_area'. This implies that a nation, similar to a physical object, has a defined spatial location. The geographic area of a nation is part of its identity, just as the location of an object is part of its physical reality.

The source role of 'object_parts' corresponds to the target role of 'nation_traits'. This suggests that a nation, like a complex physical object, is composed of various parts or traits. These could include cultural, social, political, and economic characteristics. The title of the paper ""Are They Parts of Our Nation Tanzanian and Zambian University Students' Attitude to the European and South Asian Minorities Compared"" reflects this metaphorical connection. Here, the 'parts' of the nation are metaphorically the diverse groups of people and their attitudes, which contribute to the overall structure and identity of the nation.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the concepts of *unity*, *diversity*, and *collective identity*. Just as a complex physical object is a unified whole made up of diverse parts located in a specific place, a nation is a unified entity composed of diverse groups of people located in a specific geographic area. This metaphor also encompasses the concept of *interdependence*, as the parts of a complex physical object depend on each other for the object's stability and function, just as the diverse groups within a nation depend on each other for the nation's stability and prosperity.";"unity; diversity; collective identity; interdependence"
122;NATION_IS_A_FAMILY;Family;Nation;"parents;family_members;family_whole";"nation_leaders;citizens;nation_whole";Our national arguments are family arguments we still talk to each other at the end of the day;"In the metaphor NATION_IS_A_FAMILY, the source frame is the family, and the target frame is the nation. The metaphorical connections between roles in the source frame and those in the target frame are as follows:

1. Parents in a family are metaphorically linked to nation leaders in a nation. This connection is based on the roles both play in providing guidance, setting rules, and making decisions that affect the well-being of the family or nation. This connection implies a sense of *authority* and *responsibility* that parents and nation leaders hold.

2. Family members in a family are metaphorically linked to citizens in a nation. This connection is based on the roles both play in contributing to the functioning and prosperity of the family or nation. This connection implies a sense of *participation* and *contribution* that family members and citizens have in their respective domains.

3. The family as a whole is metaphorically linked to the nation as a whole. This connection is based on the concept of a collective entity that is more than just the sum of its parts. This connection implies a sense of *unity* and *collective identity* that both family and nation share.

The example provided, ""Our national arguments are family arguments we still talk to each other at the end of the day,"" further illustrates these connections. It suggests that, just as family members may have disagreements but continue to communicate and maintain their relationships, so too do citizens in a nation have differing opinions but continue to engage in dialogue and maintain their shared national identity. This highlights the *resilience* and *endurance* of both familial and national bonds, even in the face of conflict.

Diving deeper into the metaphor, we can extract the concepts of *interdependence* and *cohesion*. Just as family members depend on each other for emotional, financial, and practical support, citizens of a nation depend on each other for economic, social, and political stability. Similarly, the cohesion within a family, maintained through shared experiences, values, and mutual support, is paralleled in the cohesion within a nation, maintained through shared culture, history, and mutual cooperation.

Furthermore, the metaphor also encompasses nuances such as *hierarchy & power dynamics* (parents/leaders having more authority), *roles & responsibilities* (different family members/citizens contributing in different ways), and *conflict resolution* (resolving disagreements through dialogue).";"authority; responsibility; participation; contribution; unity; collective identity; resilience; endurance; interdependence; cohesion; hierarchy & power dynamics; roles & responsibilities; conflict resolution"

The roles in the source frame are the machine_entity, operator_of_machine, and functional_status, which correspond to the roles in the target frame: nation_whole, nation_leaders, and state_of_nation respectively.

Conceptually, this metaphor draws a parallel between the operation of a machine and the functioning of a nation. The *machine_entity* corresponds to the *nation_whole*, suggesting that just as a machine is a complex system of interconnected parts working together, a nation is also a complex system of individuals, institutions, and infrastructure working in unison.

The *operator_of_machine* is metaphorically linked to *nation_leaders*. This implies that just as an operator controls and guides the functioning of a machine, the leaders of a nation guide its functioning and direction. The leaders' decisions and actions can affect the smooth operation of the nation, similar to how an operator's actions can affect a machine's performance.

The *functional_status* of the machine is metaphorically connected to the *state_of_nation*. This suggests that just as the functional status of a machine indicates whether it is working smoothly or experiencing problems, the state of a nation reflects its overall health, stability, and progress.

The examples provided further illustrate these connections. The phrase ""If the President doesn't show some leadership the country will grind to a halt"" demonstrates the link between the operator of a machine and nation leaders. Here, the President is likened to an operator whose lack of leadership could cause the nation (the machine) to stop functioning (grind to a halt).

In the second example, ""asked them to be serious towards bringing a full-fledged budget at the earliest to ensure that the country functions smoothly"", the budget is seen as a necessary component for the smooth operation of the nation (machine). This reflects the idea that just as a machine requires certain inputs to function properly, a nation requires resources (like a budget) to operate smoothly.

This metaphor encapsulates the dynamics of *interdependence* and *responsibility*. Just as each part of a machine and its operator have specific roles and responsibilities for the machine to function effectively, each citizen, institution, and leader in a nation has a role to play in its smooth operation. The metaphor also implies the potential for *breakdown* or *malfunction* if these responsibilities are not fulfilled, mirroring the potential for societal or economic crises in a nation.";"Machine; Nation; machine_entity; nation_whole; operator_of_machine; nation_leaders; functional_status; state_of_nation; interdependence; responsibility; breakdown; malfunction"
124;NATION_IS_A_PERSON;Person;Nation;roledata:person;nation_whole;We must rouse our nation from its slumber;"In the metaphor NATION_IS_A_PERSON, the source frame is a Person and the target frame is a Nation. The source role is a person, and the target role is the nation as a whole. The example given is ""We must rouse our nation from its slumber"".

The metaphorical connection between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame is that the nation is being personified as a person who is sleeping. This metaphorical connection is both linguistic and conceptual. Linguistically, the nation is referred to as ""our nation"", similar to how we would refer to a person as ""our friend"" or ""our family member"". Conceptually, the nation is seen as a collective entity that can be ""roused from its slumber"", much like a person can be awakened from sleep.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the concepts of *collective consciousness* and *collective action*. Just as a person can be roused from sleep to take action, a nation can be roused from a state of inactivity or complacency to take collective action. This metaphor also implies a sense of *responsibility* and *urgency*. Just as it is our responsibility to wake up a sleeping person if there is an urgent matter that needs their attention, it is our responsibility to rouse our nation if there are urgent issues that need to be addressed.

Furthermore, the metaphor suggests that a nation, like a person, can experience periods of *inactivity* or *passivity* (""slumber""), and that it can be *awakened* or *activated* to address important issues. This metaphor also implies that a nation, like a person, has a *consciousness* or *awareness* that can be awakened, and that it can take *action* or *respond* to situations in a way that is similar to a person.

Finally, the metaphor also suggests the concept of *collective identity*. Just as a person has an individual identity, a nation has a collective identity that is made up of the identities of its citizens. This collective identity can be awakened or activated, just like an individual identity can be.";"collective consciousness; collective action; responsibility; urgency; inactivity; passivity; awakened; activated; consciousness; awareness; action; respond; collective identity"

The metaphorical connections between roles in the source frame and those in the target frame are as follows:

1. The vehicle in the source frame corresponds to the nation as a whole in the target frame. This connection implies that just as a vehicle is a single entity that moves towards a destination, a nation is a collective entity that progresses towards a common goal or future. This connection highlights the concept of *collective movement*.

2. The vehicle passengers in the source frame correspond to the nation's citizens in the target frame. This connection suggests that just as passengers are the occupants of a vehicle who are affected by its movement, the citizens are the inhabitants of a nation who are impacted by its progress or lack thereof. This connection underscores the concept of *collective experience*.

3. The vehicle driver in the source frame corresponds to the nation's leaders in the target frame. This connection implies that just as a driver controls the direction and speed of a vehicle, the leaders guide the course and pace of a nation's progress. This connection highlights the concept of *leadership and control*.

4. The vehicle location in the source frame corresponds to the state of the nation in the target frame. This connection suggests that just as the location of a vehicle indicates its position or status in a journey, the state of a nation reflects its current condition or status in its progress. This connection underscores the concept of *status and progress*.

The example provided, ""Saltykov explored the psychological problems resulting from the shifting of a nation's gears of creating a new way of life,"" further illustrates these connections. The phrase ""shifting of a nation's gears"" metaphorically refers to a significant change in the nation's direction or approach, which can cause psychological problems for its citizens. This example highlights the concepts of *change and adaptation*, *collective impact*, and *psychological consequences*.

In this metaphor, the dynamics of a vehicle's operation are used to understand the complex processes within a nation. The metaphor not only compares the physical processes of driving a vehicle with the abstract processes of leading a nation but also encapsulates nuances such as *collective responsibility*, *direction & speed of progress*, and *impact of leadership decisions*.";"collective movement; collective experience; leadership and control; status and progress; change and adaptation; collective impact; psychological consequences; collective responsibility; direction & speed of progress; impact of leadership decisions"

The *operator_of_machine* in the source frame corresponds to the *head_of_organization* in the target frame. This connection suggests that just as an operator controls and directs the functioning of a machine, the head of an organization oversees and guides the operations of the organization. This metaphorical tie underscores the concept of *control* and *direction*.

The *machine_parts* in the source frame are metaphorically linked to *organization_subparts* in the target frame. This implies that just as machine parts each have a specific function that contributes to the overall operation of the machine, different subparts of an organization each have a role that contributes to the overall functioning of the organization. This connection highlights the concept of *interdependence* and *functionality*.

The *procedures_for_operation* in the source frame are connected to *organization_procedures* in the target frame. This suggests that just as a machine requires specific procedures for operation, an organization also requires specific procedures to function effectively. This connection emphasizes the concept of *systematic process* and *order*.

The *functional_status* of a machine is linked to the *organizational_efficacy* of an organization. This implies that the operational status of a machine is analogous to the effectiveness of an organization. This connection underscores the concept of *efficiency* and *performance*.

The *purpose_of_machine* in the source frame is tied to the *organization_mission* in the target frame. This suggests that just as a machine is designed for a specific purpose, an organization is established with a specific mission. This connection highlights the concept of *purpose* and *goal orientation*.

The *machine_entity* in the source frame corresponds to the *organization_whole* in the target frame. This implies that just as a machine is a single entity composed of various parts, an organization is a single entity composed of various subparts. This connection underscores the concept of *unity* and *cohesion*.

Finally, the *operating_x-schema* of a machine is linked to the *organization_management_x-schema* of an organization. This suggests that the overall schema or framework for operating a machine is analogous to the management framework of an organization. This connection emphasizes the concept of *structure* and *framework*.

In the given example, the smooth working of the three branches of state government in the transition process is likened to a well-functioning machine.

The source role is physical_structure and the target role is organized_structure. This metaphorical connection allows us to understand complex, abstract concepts related to organizations by comparing them to more concrete, tangible concepts related to physical structures.

In the given examples, the metaphorical connections are evident. For instance, ""The Lakers' defense fell apart in the final quarter leading to an embarrassing upset"" uses the language of physical structures (falling apart) to describe the performance of a sports team, an organization. This suggests a conceptual tie between the *stability* and *integrity* of a physical structure and the *cohesion* and *effectiveness* of an organization. When a physical structure falls apart, it fails to serve its purpose, just like when a team's defense falls apart, it fails to prevent the opposing team from scoring.

Similarly, in ""I admire the way this automated collection system is put together"", the organization (automated collection system) is described using the language of physical structures (put together). This implies a conceptual connection between the *construction* or *assembly* of a physical structure and the *design* or *organization* of a system. Just as a well-constructed physical structure is admired for its solidity and functionality, a well-organized system is admired for its efficiency and effectiveness.

The metaphor also implies the concept of *maintenance*. Just as physical structures require regular maintenance to remain functional and stable, organizations also need constant attention and adjustments to stay effective and efficient.

In ""Which part of the theory don't you agree with"", the theory (an organized structure of ideas) is treated as a physical structure with distinct parts. This suggests a conceptual tie between the *components* of a physical structure and the *elements* or *ideas* in a theory. Just as one can disagree with a part of a physical structure (for example, its design or material), one can also disagree with a part of a theory (its assumptions or conclusions).

Overall, the metaphor ORGANIZATION_IS_PHYSICAL_STRUCTURE allows us to understand and discuss abstract organizational concepts in terms of more concrete and familiar physical structure concepts. This includes the *stability*, *construction*, *maintenance*, and *components* of organizations.";"stability; integrity; cohesion; effectiveness; construction; assembly; design; organization; maintenance; components; elements; ideas; stability; construction; maintenance; components"
128;POLITICAL_REGION_IS_A_VEHICLE;Vehicle;Political_region;"vehicle;passengers";"governing_institution;population";"They are rocking the ship of state ; Dirt threatens to sink ship of state headline";"In the metaphor POLITICAL_REGION_IS_A_VEHICLE, the source frame is Vehicle and the target frame is Political_region. The source roles are vehicle and passengers, while the target roles are governing_institution and population.

Conceptually, this metaphor is drawing a parallel between the dynamics of a vehicle and its passengers, and a political region with its governing institution and population. The vehicle, in this case, is a metaphor for the *governing institution*. Just as a vehicle is steered and controlled by someone, a political region is governed and directed by its governing institution. This implies a sense of *control*, *direction*, and *responsibility* on the part of the governing institution.

The passengers, on the other hand, represent the *population*. Just as passengers are carried by the vehicle and are affected by its direction and speed, the population is affected by the decisions and actions of the governing institution. This suggests a sense of *dependency*, *vulnerability*, and *collective destiny*.

The examples provided, ""They are rocking the ship of state"" and ""Dirt threatens to sink ship of state headline"", further illustrate this metaphor. In the first example, the act of ""rocking the ship"" implies causing instability or disturbance in the political region. This could be interpreted as a critique of the governing institution's actions or decisions. In the second example, ""dirt"" could metaphorically represent corruption or scandal, which threatens to ""sink"" or ruin the political region. This highlights the *fragility* and *responsibility* of the governing institution, and the potential *consequences* of its actions on the population.

In summary, the metaphor POLITICAL_REGION_IS_A_VEHICLE encapsulates concepts such as *control*, *direction*, *responsibility*, *dependency*, *vulnerability*, *collective destiny*, *fragility*, and *consequences*. It underscores the intricate relationship between a governing institution and its population, and the potential impact of the former's actions on the latter.";"governing institution; control; direction; responsibility; population; dependency; vulnerability; collective destiny; fragility; responsibility; consequences; control; direction; responsibility; dependency; vulnerability; collective destiny; fragility; consequences"
129;POVERTY_IS_A_CRIME;Crime;Poverty;victim;impoverished_entity; He appealed to logos logic by trying to analyze why poverty is a crime and tries to differentiate it from being poor;"In the metaphor POVERTY_IS_A_CRIME, the source frame is Crime and the target frame is Poverty. The source role is the victim, which corresponds to the target role of the impoverished_entity. This metaphorical connection suggests that those who are impoverished are seen as victims, similar to how victims are perceived in the context of a crime.

The metaphor implies that poverty, like crime, is a *violation* or *transgression* against societal norms or expectations. It suggests that poverty is not just a state of economic deprivation but a condition that is *punishable* or *blameworthy*. This metaphorical connection between poverty and crime can be seen as a critique of societal structures that criminalize poverty instead of addressing its root causes.

The linguistic tie in the example sentence 'He appealed to logos logic by trying to analyze why poverty is a crime and tries to differentiate it from being poor 'poverty is a crime'' is the direct comparison of poverty to a crime. The speaker is using *logical reasoning* (logos) to argue that poverty is not just a state of being poor but a crime. This suggests a deeper conceptual tie: the idea that poverty, like a crime, is a *systemic issue* that needs to be addressed at a societal level.

The metaphor also implies a sense of *injustice* and *inequality*. In the crime frame, the victim is often seen as someone who has been wronged or treated unfairly. By mapping this role onto the impoverished_entity in the poverty frame, the metaphor suggests that those in poverty are also victims of unfair circumstances or systemic failures.

Furthermore, the metaphor implies a *moral judgment* about poverty. In the crime frame, crimes are seen as morally wrong actions. By comparing poverty to a crime, the metaphor suggests that poverty is also a moral failing, either on the part of the impoverished individual or society as a whole.

In conclusion, the metaphor POVERTY_IS_A_CRIME connects the roles of victims in the crime frame to the impoverished entities in the poverty frame, suggesting that poverty is a violation, a systemic issue, an injustice, and a moral failing. These connections highlight the complex dynamics of poverty and the societal attitudes towards it.";"violation; transgression; punishable; blameworthy; logical reasoning; systemic issue; injustice; inequality; moral judgment"

The roles in the source frame are patient and disease, while in the target frame, the roles are impoverished_entity and impoverished_state.

The metaphorical connections between these roles can be identified as follows:

1. The *patient* in the source frame is metaphorically linked to the *impoverished_entity* in the target frame. Just as a patient is affected by a disease, an impoverished entity is affected by poverty. This connection highlights the *vulnerability* and *suffering* experienced by both the patient and the impoverished entity.

2. The *disease* in the source frame is metaphorically connected to the *impoverished_state* in the target frame. Just as a disease is a harmful condition that affects the health of a patient, poverty is a harmful state that affects the well-being of an impoverished entity. This connection emphasizes the *destructive* and *pervasive* nature of both disease and poverty.

The metaphor also implies that poverty, like a disease, is *contagious* and *spreading*, as seen in the example ""The epidemic of poverty is spreading in America"". This suggests that poverty can affect anyone, just like a disease, and that it can spread from one entity to another, just like an infectious disease.

Furthermore, the metaphor implies that poverty, like a disease, has *symptoms* that need to be treated, as seen in the example ""As President Obama has said we can't treat the symptoms of poverty in isolation"". This suggests that poverty, like a disease, is a complex problem that requires a comprehensive solution.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the concepts of *infection*, *contagion*, *suffering*, and *treatment*. These concepts are used to highlight the severity of poverty and the urgent need for effective solutions.

In conclusion, the metaphor POVERTY_IS_A_DISEASE uses the roles and dynamics of a disease to conceptualize and communicate the nature, impact, and urgency of poverty. This metaphor not only provides a vivid and powerful way to understand poverty, but also calls for a compassionate and comprehensive response to it.";"patient; impoverished_entity; vulnerability; suffering; disease; impoverished_state; destructive; pervasive; contagious; spreading; symptoms; infection; contagion; suffering; treatment"

The metaphorical connections between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame are as follows:

1. The role of 'mover_location' in the source frame corresponds to the 'impoverished_state' in the target frame. This suggests that the metaphor views poverty as a *location* or *state* that one is stuck in, similar to how a physical impediment can prevent movement from one location to another. This highlights the conceptual tie of *immobility* or *stagnation*.

2. The 'mover' in the source frame is metaphorically linked to the 'impoverished_entity' in the target frame. This implies that the people or entities experiencing poverty are seen as *attempting to move* or progress, but are hindered by their impoverished state. This draws a linguistic and conceptual parallel between the struggle to overcome physical impediments and the struggle to escape poverty.

3. The 'impediment' in the source frame is connected to the 'cause_of_impoverished_state' in the target frame. This suggests that the metaphor views the causes of poverty as *obstacles* or *barriers* that prevent movement or progress, similar to how a physical impediment can block or hinder motion. This highlights the conceptual tie of *obstruction* or *hindrance*.

The example sentence ""Though politically the country is free its people remain chained by poverty"" illustrates these connections. The phrase ""chained by poverty"" linguistically mirrors the idea of a motion impediment, reinforcing the metaphor's underlying dynamics. The political freedom of the country is contrasted with the economic stagnation of its people, emphasizing the *paradox* of freedom and confinement within the same entity.

The metaphor POVERTY_IS_A_MOTION_IMPEDIMENT encapsulates the complex dynamics of poverty, including the *struggle* to escape it, the *obstacles* that perpetuate it, and the *stagnation* it causes. It also implicitly suggests the need for *external intervention* or *assistance*, as overcoming a physical impediment often requires help from others or the use of tools. This metaphor thus provides a powerful tool for understanding and discussing poverty.";"location; state; immobility; stagnation; attempting to move; obstacles; barriers; obstruction; hindrance; paradox; struggle; obstacles; stagnation; external intervention; assistance"

The source roles are food_preparer and food, while the target roles are thinker and ideas.

The metaphorical connections between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame are as follows: The food_preparer corresponds to the thinker, and the food corresponds to the ideas. This metaphorical mapping suggests that the process of preparing food is analogous to the process of developing and refining ideas.

The linguistic ties between these roles are evident in the examples provided. Phrases like ""half-baked ideas,"" ""raw facts,"" and ""put this on the back burner"" are all culinary terms used metaphorically to describe cognitive processes.

Conceptually, this metaphor suggests that ideas, like food, require *preparation* and *processing* to be properly understood and appreciated. Just as a chef must carefully select, prepare, and cook ingredients to create a satisfying meal, a thinker must carefully develop, refine, and present ideas to effectively communicate them.

This metaphor also implies that, like food, ideas can be in different stages of preparation. ""Half-baked ideas"" suggest ideas that are not fully developed or thought through, while ""raw facts"" suggest unprocessed information that has not yet been interpreted or analyzed. The phrase ""put this on the back burner"" suggests the idea of temporarily setting aside an idea or issue, much like a chef might set a pot to simmer while focusing on other tasks.

This metaphor also encompasses nuances such as *quality of preparation*, *timing*, and *patience*. Just as food preparation requires skill, time, and patience, so too does the process of developing and refining ideas.

Overall, this metaphor highlights the *complexity* and *dynamism* of the cognitive process, comparing it to the tangible, familiar process of preparing food.";"preparation; processing; quality of preparation; timing; patience; complexity; dynamism"
133;PROVING_IS_SHOWING;Cause_to_see;Reasoning;perception_causer;reasoner;The marks on the carpet show that the perpetrator wore boots;"In the metaphor PROVING_IS_SHOWING, the source frame is Cause_to_see, and the target frame is Reasoning. The source role is perception_causer, and the target role is reasoner. The example given is, ""The marks on the carpet show that the perpetrator wore boots.""

The metaphorical connection between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame is that the *perception_causer* (the marks on the carpet) in the source frame is metaphorically linked to the *reasoner* in the target frame. This connection is based on the idea that the *perception_causer* provides evidence or clues that lead to a conclusion, similar to how a *reasoner* uses logic and evidence to arrive at a conclusion.

The linguistic tie between these roles is the verb ""show,"" which is used in both the source and target frames to indicate the process of revealing or making something clear. Conceptually, this metaphor suggests that the process of reasoning (proving something) is similar to the process of causing someone to see something (showing something).

Diving deeper into the metaphor, we can extract the concepts of *evidence* and *interpretation*. In the source frame, the marks on the carpet are physical evidence that needs to be interpreted to understand what they signify. Similarly, in the target frame, the reasoner interprets evidence to arrive at a conclusion. This suggests that the process of reasoning involves not just the collection of evidence, but also the interpretation of that evidence.

Furthermore, the metaphor implies that proving something is not a passive process, but an active one that requires effort and skill, just like showing something to someone requires effort to make it visible and understandable. This highlights the concepts of *active engagement* and *skillful interpretation*.

Finally, the metaphor also suggests a certain level of *objectivity* in the reasoning process. Just as the marks on the carpet are objective evidence that can be seen by anyone, the reasoning process is also seen as being based on objective evidence that can be examined and evaluated by others. This underscores the importance of *transparency* and *verifiability* in the reasoning process.";"perception_causer; reasoner; perception_causer; reasoner; evidence; interpretation; active engagement; skillful interpretation; objectivity; transparency; verifiability"
134;PURITY_IS_CLEANLINESS;Cleanliness;Purity;"clean_substance;impurities";"pure_substance;substances";"He's pure evil; Her soul was scrubbed clean of impurities scrubbed clean ";"In the metaphor PURITY_IS_CLEANLINESS, the source frame is Cleanliness, and the target frame is Purity. The source roles are clean_substance and impurities, while the target roles are pure_substance and substances.

The metaphorical connection between the source and target frames is the concept of *removal of impurities* to achieve a state of *purity* or *cleanliness*. This is a conceptual tie that links the two frames. In the source frame, a substance is cleaned by removing impurities, while in the target frame, a substance becomes pure by eliminating substances that contaminate it.

The linguistic tie is evident in the example provided: ""He's pure evil"" and ""Her soul was scrubbed clean of impurities"". The word ""pure"" in the first sentence is used in the target language to describe the state of being entirely evil, while ""scrubbed clean"" in the second sentence is used in the source language to describe the act of removing impurities.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the concept of *transformation* and *purification*. Just as a dirty substance can be transformed into a clean one by removing impurities, a substance can be purified by eliminating unwanted elements. This metaphor also encompasses nuances such as *moral cleanliness*, *spiritual purity*, and *the struggle between good and evil*.

The metaphor suggests that purity, like cleanliness, is not an inherent state but a result of a process of removal or elimination. This process can be physical, as in cleaning a dirty object, or abstract, as in purifying one's soul or character. The metaphor also implies that both cleanliness and purity are desirable states, associated with goodness and virtue.

In conclusion, the metaphor PURITY_IS_CLEANLINESS conceptualizes purity as a state achieved by the removal of impurities, similar to how cleanliness is achieved. This metaphor not only links physical cleanliness with abstract purity but also suggests a moral dimension, associating purity and cleanliness with positive values.";"removal of impurities; purity; cleanliness; transformation; purification; moral cleanliness; spiritual purity; the struggle between good and evil"

This metaphor is based on our embodied experiences of movement and goal-directed actions.

In the source frame, 'Self_propelled_motion_to_a_destination', the roles include the 'goal', 'self-mover', 'path', and 'self-motion_x-schema'. These roles correspond to 'objective', 'actor', 'action_x-schema_kind', and 'action_x-schema' in the target frame, 'Purposeful_action'.

The 'goal' in the source frame is the destination or end point of the self-propelled motion. This is metaphorically linked to the 'objective' in the target frame, which is the intended result or aim of the purposeful action. This connection highlights the concept of *directionality* and *intentionality* in both self-propelled motion and purposeful action.

The 'self-mover' in the source frame, the entity that initiates and carries out the motion, is metaphorically connected to the 'actor' in the target frame, the individual or entity that performs the purposeful action. This connection emphasizes the concept of *agency* and *autonomy*, as both the self-mover and actor are responsible for initiating and executing the motion or action.

The 'path' in the source frame, the route taken by the self-mover to reach the goal, is linked to the 'action_x-schema_kind' in the target frame, the specific type of action taken to achieve the objective. This connection underscores the concept of *strategy* or *method*, as both the path and action_x-schema_kind represent the means to reach the end.

The 'self-motion_x-schema' in the source frame, the pattern or manner of the self-propelled motion, is connected to the 'action_x-schema' in the target frame, the pattern or manner of the purposeful action. This connection highlights the concept of *dynamics* and *process*, as both self-motion_x-schema and action_x-schema describe the unfolding of the motion or action over time.

The examples provided further illustrate these metaphorical connections. For instance, ""She made great strides in her dissertation"" uses the metaphor of physical movement to describe progress in a purposeful action. Similarly, ""We are sliding backward"" uses the metaphor of backward movement to describe regression or lack of progress. These examples demonstrate how the metaphor PURPOSEFUL_ACTION_IS_SELF-PROPELLED_MOTION_TO_A_DESTINATION helps us conceptualize abstract processes of purposeful action in terms of more concrete experiences of self-propelled motion.";"directionality; intentionality; agency; autonomy; strategy; method; dynamics; process"

The roles in the source frame, such as the self-mover, self-motion_x-schema, and goal, are metaphorically connected to the roles in the target frame, namely the thinker, thinking_x_frame, and desired_knowledge.

The *self-mover* in the source frame is metaphorically linked to the *thinker* in the target frame. This connection suggests that just as a self-mover initiates and controls their movement towards a destination, the thinker initiates and controls their thought process towards a particular knowledge or understanding. This highlights the concept of *autonomy* and *control* in both physical motion and thinking process.

The *self-motion_x-schema* in the source frame is connected to the *thinking_x_frame* in the target frame. This implies that the process or path taken by the self-mover to reach the goal is parallel to the cognitive process or path taken by the thinker to reach the desired knowledge. This connection underscores the concept of *process* and *path*, suggesting that both physical motion and thinking involve a series of steps or a certain route to reach the end goal.

The *goal* in the source frame is metaphorically linked to the *desired_knowledge* in the target frame. This suggests that the destination of the self-mover is akin to the knowledge or understanding that the thinker aims to achieve. This connection emphasizes the concept of *destination* or *end result*, indicating that both physical motion and thinking are directed towards achieving a certain outcome.

In this metaphor, the underlying dynamics involve the comparison of the physical process of self-propelled motion to the cognitive process of purposeful thinking. The metaphor suggests that just as self-propelled motion involves a self-mover taking a certain path to reach a destination, purposeful thinking involves a thinker going through a cognitive process to achieve desired knowledge. This comparison not only highlights the similarities between physical motion and thinking but also underscores the concepts of *autonomy*, *process*, and *destination* in both domains.";"self-mover; thinker; autonomy; control; self-motion_x-schema; thinking_x_frame; process; path; goal; desired_knowledge; destination; end result; autonomy; process; destination"

The roles in the source frame are entity, size_scale, entity_size, and scalar_position, while the roles in the target frame are entity, quantity_scale, entity_amount, and measure_of_quantity.

The metaphorical connections between the roles in the source and target frames are as follows:

- The *entity* in the source frame corresponds to the *entity* in the target frame. In the given examples, the entities are 'your bank account' and 'our national debt'.
- The *size_scale* in the source frame is metaphorically linked to the *quantity_scale* in the target frame. This represents the scale or range within which the size or quantity is measured.
- The *entity_size* in the source frame is connected to the *entity_amount* in the target frame. This refers to the actual size of the entity in the source frame and the actual quantity of the entity in the target frame.
- The *scalar_position* in the source frame corresponds to the *measure_of_quantity* in the target frame. This represents the position of the entity's size on the size scale and the entity's quantity on the quantity scale.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the conceptualization of abstract quantities as physical sizes. This is a common cognitive process, as humans often understand abstract concepts by relating them to more concrete, tangible experiences. In this case, the abstract concept of quantity is understood in terms of the more concrete concept of size.

Key concepts in this metaphor include *comparison* and *measurement*. Just as we compare and measure physical sizes, we also compare and measure abstract quantities. Another key concept is *perception*. The way we perceive physical sizes can influence the way we perceive abstract quantities. For example, a large physical size can imply a large quantity, and vice versa.

Finally, this metaphor also involves the concept of *scale*. Both physical sizes and abstract quantities can be placed on a scale, which allows us to compare and measure them. This concept of scale is crucial for our understanding of both size and quantity.";"entity; entity; size_scale; quantity_scale; entity_size; entity_amount; scalar_position; measure_of_quantity; comparison; measurement; perception; scale"
138;QUANTITY_IS_VERTICALITY;Verticality;Quantity;"verticality_scale;scalar_position";"quantity_scale;measure_of_quantity";"The number of books printed each year keeps going up; His income fell last year";"In the metaphor QUANTITY_IS_VERTICALITY, the source frame is Verticality and the target frame is Quantity. The source role is the verticality_scale or scalar_position, and the target role is the quantity_scale or measure_of_quantity.

The metaphorical connection between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame is that the concept of *verticality* is used to understand and describe the concept of *quantity*. This is a common metaphorical connection in many cultures, where an increase in quantity is often described using terms that denote upward movement, and a decrease in quantity is described using terms that denote downward movement.

The conceptual ties between these roles are based on the inherent *directionality* in both verticality and quantity. Just as verticality has an inherent up-down directionality, quantity also has an inherent more-less directionality. By mapping the up-down directionality of verticality onto the more-less directionality of quantity, we can understand and describe changes in quantity in terms of vertical movement.

For example, in the sentence ""The number of books printed each year keeps going up"", the increase in the number of books is described in terms of upward movement. Similarly, in the sentence ""His income fell last year"", the decrease in income is described in terms of downward movement.

This metaphor also highlights the concept of *scale*, which is implicit in both verticality and quantity. Just as verticality involves a scale from low to high, quantity involves a scale from less to more. By mapping the vertical scale onto the quantity scale, we can understand and describe changes in quantity in terms of movement along a vertical scale.

In essence, the QUANTITY_IS_VERTICALITY metaphor involves the *transformation* of the abstract concept of quantity into the more concrete concept of verticality. This transformation allows us to understand and describe changes in quantity in terms of the more familiar and tangible experience of vertical movement. This metaphor also involves the *internalization* of the verticality concept, as we internalize the up-down directionality of verticality to understand the more-less directionality of quantity.";"verticality; quantity; directionality; scale; transformation; internalization"
139;RELATIONSHIPS_ARE_COMPLEX_STRUCTURES;Complex_physical_object;Relationship;"object_part_relations;object_whole;object_parts";"inter-relation;relationship_whole;related_entities";"It takes work to build any relationship; The relationship fell apa";"In the metaphor RELATIONSHIPS_ARE_COMPLEX_STRUCTURES, the source frame is a Complex_physical_object and the target frame is a Relationship. This metaphorical connection implies that relationships, like complex physical structures, are composed of multiple parts that are interconnected and interdependent.

The source role of object_part_relations corresponds to the target role of inter-relation. This suggests that just as the parts of a complex physical object are related to each other in specific ways, the entities involved in a relationship are also interrelated. This highlights the concept of *interdependence* in relationships, where the actions or states of one entity can significantly impact the other.

The source role of object_whole corresponds to the target role of relationship_whole. This implies that just as a complex physical object is more than just the sum of its parts, a relationship is also more than just the sum of the interactions between the entities involved. This brings forth the concept of *synergy* in relationships, where the whole relationship can have properties or qualities that are not present in the individual entities or their interactions.

The source role of object_parts corresponds to the target role of related_entities. This suggests that just as a complex physical object is made up of individual parts, a relationship is made up of individual entities. This highlights the concept of *individuality* within relationships, where each entity maintains its distinct identity even as it becomes part of the relationship.

The examples provided, ""It takes work to build any relationship"" and ""The relationship fell apart"", further illustrate these connections. Building a relationship, like constructing a complex physical structure, requires effort, planning, and coordination of the different parts. Similarly, a relationship falling apart can be likened to a physical structure collapsing, indicating the failure of the interrelations and synergy that held it together.

In conclusion, the metaphor RELATIONSHIPS_ARE_COMPLEX_STRUCTURES encapsulates the concepts of *interdependence*, *synergy*, and *individuality* within relationships. It suggests that relationships, like complex physical objects, are intricate, multifaceted, and require careful construction and maintenance.";"interdependence; synergy; individuality; interdependence; synergy; individuality"
140;RELATIONSHIPS_ARE_CONTAINERS;Containing;Relationship;"container;contents";"relationship;relationship_participants";"She's trapped in a relationship with a scumbag ; They had a falling out";"In the metaphor RELATIONSHIPS_ARE_CONTAINERS, the source frame is Containing and the target frame is Relationship. The source roles are container and contents, while the target roles are relationship and relationship_participants.

The metaphorical connection between the source and target frames is that a relationship is conceptualized as a container that holds the participants. This metaphor allows us to understand relationships in terms of physical spaces that can be entered, exited, or trapped within.

The source role of container corresponds to the target role of relationship. This implies that a relationship, like a container, has boundaries that define its scope and limit. It can be *restrictive* or *protective*, depending on the nature of the relationship.

The source role of contents corresponds to the target role of relationship_participants. This suggests that the individuals in a relationship are contained within it, much like objects within a physical container. This highlights the *interconnectedness* and *interdependence* of the participants, as well as their *confinement* within the relationship.

The example ""She's trapped in a relationship with a scumbag"" illustrates the metaphor by portraying the relationship as a container from which one cannot escape. This reflects the *imprisonment* aspect of the metaphor, emphasizing the negative, restrictive side of the relationship.

The phrase ""They had a falling out"" also supports the metaphor by implying that the relationship, like a container, can be broken or damaged, causing the contents (participants) to spill out or separate. This underscores the *fragility* and *impermanence* of relationships.

In summary, the RELATIONSHIPS_ARE_CONTAINERS metaphor provides a framework for understanding relationships in terms of physical spaces, emphasizing aspects such as *restriction*, *protection*, *interconnectedness*, *confinement*, *imprisonment*, *fragility*, and *impermanence*.";"restrictive; protective; interconnectedness; interdependence; confinement; imprisonment; fragility; impermanence; restriction; protection; interconnectedness; confinement; imprisonment; fragility; impermanence"
141;RELATIONSHIPS_ARE_OBJECTS;Object;Relationship;object_entity;relation;"Our relationship is rock solid ; She has a fragile relationship with her mother as it is";"In the metaphor RELATIONSHIPS_ARE_OBJECTS, the source frame is the Object, and the target frame is the Relationship. The source role is the object_entity, and the target role is the relation. This metaphorical mapping suggests that relationships, like objects, can have certain properties and characteristics.

The first example, ""Our relationship is rock solid,"" implies that the relationship is *strong* and *stable*, much like a rock. The solidity of a rock is metaphorically mapped onto the relationship, suggesting that it is unshakeable and enduring. This metaphorical connection implies the concept of *durability* and *resilience* in relationships, similar to the physical properties of a rock.

The second example, ""She has a fragile relationship with her mother as it is,"" suggests that the relationship is *delicate* and *easily broken*, much like a fragile object. The fragility of an object is metaphorically mapped onto the relationship, indicating that it is vulnerable and can easily fall apart. This metaphorical connection implies the concept of *vulnerability* and *instability* in relationships, similar to the physical properties of a fragile object.

In both examples, the *physical properties* of the objects (rock and fragile object) are metaphorically transferred to the relationships, highlighting their *emotional states*. This metaphor also implies that relationships, like objects, can be *handled*, *worked on*, or *changed*, suggesting a sense of *agency* and *responsibility* in maintaining or improving relationships.

Moreover, the metaphor RELATIONSHIPS_ARE_OBJECTS also encompasses nuances such as *value & worth* (objects can be valuable or worthless), *maintenance & care* (objects require care to maintain their condition), and *ownership & possession* (objects can be owned, lost, or given away), which can be metaphorically applied to relationships.";"strong; stable; durability; resilience; delicate; easily broken; vulnerability; instability; physical properties; emotional states; handled; worked on; changed; agency; responsibility; value & worth; maintenance & care; ownership & possession"

The metaphorical connections between roles in the source frame and those in the target frame are as follows:

1. *Structure_creator* in the source frame corresponds to *related_entity_1* and *related_entity_2* in the target frame. This implies that just as a builder constructs a physical structure, individuals in a relationship are the creators of their bond. They are the ones who shape, build, and maintain the relationship.

2. *Base_support* in the source frame corresponds to *relation_basis* in the target frame. This suggests that just as a physical structure needs a solid foundation to stand, a relationship requires a strong basis, such as trust and commitment, to thrive.

3. *Structural_framework* in the source frame corresponds to *relation_framework* in the target frame. This implies that just as a physical structure has a framework that gives it shape and form, a relationship has a framework, which could be the shared values, norms, and expectations that give it shape and form.

4. *Structural_stability* in the source frame corresponds to *relationship_status* in the target frame. This suggests that just as the stability of a physical structure indicates its strength and durability, the status of a relationship indicates its strength and durability.

5. *Structure_whole* in the source frame corresponds to *relationship* in the target frame. This implies that just as a physical structure is a whole entity, a relationship is also a whole entity, composed of various elements like trust, commitment, shared experiences, and mutual respect.

6. *Change_in_integrity* in the source frame corresponds to *change_in_relationship_intensity* in the target frame. This suggests that just as changes in the integrity of a physical structure can indicate damage or improvement, changes in the intensity of a relationship can indicate deterioration or improvement.

7. *Structural_integrity* in the source frame corresponds to *relationship_intensity* in the target frame. This implies that just as the integrity of a physical structure indicates its overall quality and condition, the intensity of a relationship indicates its overall quality and condition.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the comparison of relationships to physical structures, highlighting the concepts of *creation*, *foundation*, *framework*, *stability*, *wholeness*, *change*, and *integrity*. These concepts are essential in both physical structures and relationships, emphasizing the importance of a strong foundation, a clear framework, stability, and integrity in maintaining a healthy relationship.";"Structure_creator; related_entity_1; related_entity_2; Base_support; relation_basis; Structural_framework; relation_framework; Structural_stability; relationship_status; Structure_whole; relationship; Change_in_integrity; change_in_relationship_intensity; Structural_integrity; relationship_intensity; creation; foundation; framework; stability; wholeness; change; integrity"
143;ROMANTIC_RELATIONSHIPS_ARE_VEHICLES;Vehicle;Romantic_relationship;vehicle;relationship;Our relationship is veering off-course;"In the metaphor ROMANTIC_RELATIONSHIPS_ARE_VEHICLES, the source frame is a Vehicle, and the target frame is a Romantic_relationship. The source role is a vehicle, and the target role is a relationship. The example given is ""Our relationship is veering off-course, Elise.""

The metaphorical connections between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame are numerous and intricate. The vehicle in the source frame represents the *relationship* in the target frame. This metaphorical connection implies that a romantic relationship, like a vehicle, requires *maintenance* and *care* to function properly. It also suggests that a relationship, like a vehicle, can *move forward*, *change direction*, or even *break down*.

The concept of *direction* is key in this metaphor. In the context of a vehicle, direction refers to the path or course the vehicle is taking. In the context of a romantic relationship, direction can refer to the progress or development of the relationship. When the example states that the relationship is ""veering off-course,"" it implies that the relationship is deviating from its intended or desired path, possibly indicating problems or conflicts.

Another important concept in this metaphor is *control*. In a vehicle, control is exerted by the driver who steers the vehicle, accelerates, or brakes as needed. In a romantic relationship, control can refer to the actions and decisions of the people involved in the relationship. If a relationship is ""veering off-course,"" it may suggest a loss of control or a lack of agreement between the partners about the direction of the relationship.

The metaphor also implies a sense of *journey* or *adventure*. A vehicle is often used for traveling, suggesting movement, exploration, and sometimes unpredictability. Similarly, a romantic relationship can be seen as a journey with its own ups and downs, discoveries, and unexpected turns.

In summary, the ROMANTIC_RELATIONSHIPS_ARE_VEHICLES metaphor encapsulates several key concepts, including *maintenance*, *direction*, *control*, and *journey*. These concepts provide a rich, nuanced understanding of the dynamics of romantic relationships.";"relationship; maintenance; care; move forward; change direction; break down; direction; control; journey; adventure; maintenance; direction; control; journey"

The metaphorical connections between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame are as follows:

1. The *journeyer* in the source frame corresponds to the *relationship participant* in the target frame. This connection implies that the individuals involved in a romantic relationship are on a journey, navigating through the course of the relationship. The concept of *navigation* is key here, as it suggests a sense of direction, purpose, and progress.

2. The *obstacles_impediments_in_journey* in the source frame relate to the *difficulties_in_a_relationship* in the target frame. This connection suggests that just as a journey may have obstacles, a romantic relationship may also face difficulties. The concept of *overcoming challenges* is implicit here, indicating resilience and adaptability.

3. The *path_of_journey* in the source frame corresponds to the *course_of_relationship* in the target frame. This connection implies that the course of a romantic relationship is like a path that the participants traverse. The concept of *progression* is central here, indicating the development and evolution of the relationship over time.

4. The *vehicle* in the source frame is linked to the *relationship* in the target frame. This connection suggests that the relationship itself is the vehicle that carries the participants along the journey. The concept of *movement* is key here, implying forward motion and change.

5. The *co_journeyer* in the source frame corresponds to the *relationship_co_participant* in the target frame. This connection implies that the participants in a romantic relationship are co-journeyers, sharing the experiences of the journey. The concept of *partnership* is central here, indicating mutual support and shared responsibility.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the concepts of *exploration*, *adventure*, *uncertainty*, and *discovery*, which are inherent in a journey and can also be applied to a romantic relationship. The metaphor also encompasses nuances such as *shared experiences*, *mutual growth*, and *navigating challenges together*.";"journeyer; relationship participant; navigation; obstacles_impediments_in_journey; difficulties_in_a_relationship; overcoming challenges; path_of_journey; course_of_relationship; progression; vehicle; relationship; movement; co_journeyer; relationship_co_participant; partnership; exploration; adventure; uncertainty; discovery; shared experiences; mutual growth; navigating challenges together"

The metaphorical connections between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame can be identified as follows:

- The *source* in the source frame corresponds to the *minimal value* in the target frame. This represents the starting point of a journey or the lowest point on a scale.

- The *trajector* in the source frame corresponds to the *position on the scale* in the target frame. This signifies the entity moving along the path or the current position on the scale.

- The *landmark* in the source frame corresponds to the *norm* in the target frame. This represents a significant point of reference along the path or a standard or average value on the scale.

- The *path* in the source frame corresponds to the *intermediate values* in the target frame. This signifies the route taken by the trajector or the range of values between the minimal and maximal values on the scale.

- The *goal* in the source frame corresponds to the *maximal value* in the target frame. This represents the destination of the journey or the highest point on the scale.

The conceptual ties between these roles highlight the underlying dynamics of the metaphor. The metaphor SCALES_ARE_PATHS suggests that the process of moving along a scale can be conceptualized as a journey along a path. This involves a *transformation* from a starting point to an end point, with various significant points and values along the way.

Just as a journey involves movement, direction, and progression, so does the movement along a scale. The *direction* of the movement (up or down the scale) can be compared to the direction of a journey (towards the goal or away from it). The *progression* along the scale can be compared to the progression along a path, with intermediate values and landmarks serving as points of reference.

Moreover, the metaphor encompasses nuances such as *achievement & progress*, *measurement & comparison*, and *direction & orientation*. Just as a journey involves overcoming obstacles and reaching a destination, moving along a scale involves achieving a certain value or reaching a certain position. The process of measurement and comparison on a scale parallels the process of determining one's position and direction on a path.";"source; minimal value; trajector; position on the scale; landmark; norm; path; intermediate values; goal; maximal value; transformation; direction; progression; achievement & progress; measurement & comparison; direction & orientation"

The roles in the source frame, such as tactile_input, touched_thing, toucher, touch_bodypart, and sense_of_touch, are metaphorically connected to the roles in the target frame, such as visual_input, seen_object, seer, eyes, and visual_ability.

The metaphorical connections between these roles can be understood as follows:

1. *Tactile_input* is connected to *visual_input*. This suggests that the act of seeing is metaphorically understood as a form of touching, where the eyes 'touch' or interact with the object being seen. This implies a sense of *directness* and *immediacy* in the act of seeing, similar to the physical contact involved in touching.

2. *Touched_thing* is connected to *seen_object*. This implies that the object being seen is metaphorically understood as being 'touched' by the eyes. This highlights the *intimacy* and *closeness* of the act of seeing, akin to the physical contact of touching.

3. *Toucher* is connected to *seer*. This suggests that the person seeing is metaphorically understood as the person touching. This implies a sense of *agency* and *control* in the act of seeing, similar to the active role of the toucher.

4. *Touch_bodypart* is connected to *eyes*. This implies that the eyes are metaphorically understood as the body part that 'touches' or interacts with the visual world. This highlights the *physicality* and *sensory nature* of the act of seeing, akin to the tactile experience of touch.

5. *Sense_of_touch* is connected to *visual_ability*. This suggests that the ability to see is metaphorically understood as a form of 'touching' or interacting with the world. This implies a sense of *engagement* and *interaction* in the act of seeing, similar to the sensory engagement of touch.

The example ""His eyes scoured the horizon"" illustrates these metaphorical connections. The act of 'scouring' implies a thorough, tactile exploration, suggesting a metaphorical 'touching' of the horizon with the eyes. This highlights the *intensity*, *thoroughness*, and *engagement* of the act of seeing, akin to the active, physical nature of touching.";"Tactile_input; visual_input; directness; immediacy; Touched_thing; seen_object; intimacy; closeness; Toucher; seer; agency; control; Touch_bodypart; eyes; physicality; sensory nature; Sense_of_touch; visual_ability; engagement; interaction; intensity; thoroughness; engagement"

The metaphorical connections between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame can be understood as follows:

1. The ""sought_object"" in the source frame corresponds to the ""sought_knowledge"" in the target frame. This suggests that *knowledge* is perceived as an *object* that can be sought or searched for, implying a sense of *tangibility* to knowledge. This also implies that knowledge is something that exists independently and can be discovered or uncovered, much like an object can be found.

2. The ""looking_for_object_x-schema"" in the source frame corresponds to the ""seeking_to_know_x-schema"" in the target frame. This implies that the act of seeking knowledge is akin to the act of searching for an object. This connection suggests that acquiring knowledge involves a *process* or *journey*, much like searching for an object. It also implies that knowledge is not always readily available or easily accessible, but must be actively sought after.

3. The ""seeker_of_some_object"" in the source frame corresponds to the ""knowledge_seeker"" in the target frame. This connection implies that the person seeking knowledge is akin to a searcher or explorer, suggesting a sense of *adventure* or *exploration* in the pursuit of knowledge. This also implies that the seeker has a *goal* or *destination* in mind, much like a searcher has a specific object they are looking for.

The example ""He's looking for meaning in his life and isn't finding any"" illustrates these connections. The person is portrayed as a seeker, actively searching for meaning (knowledge) in his life (the object of his search). The fact that he isn't finding any suggests the difficulty and challenge inherent in the search for knowledge.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve concepts such as *discovery*, *exploration*, *challenge*, and *tangibility*. It portrays the pursuit of knowledge as an active, challenging journey of discovery, rather than a passive receipt of information. It also gives a sense of tangibility to knowledge, portraying it as an object that can be found or discovered.";"knowledge; object; tangibility; process; journey; adventure; exploration; goal; destination; discovery; exploration; challenge; tangibility"
148;SELECTION_IS_ADOPTION;Adoption;Selection;"adoptee;candidates;family_representative";"selection_option;options;selector";They adopted the customs of their neighbors;"In the metaphor SELECTION_IS_ADOPTION, the source frame is Adoption and the target frame is Selection. The metaphorical connections between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame are as follows:

- The adoptee in the source frame is metaphorically connected to the selection_option in the target frame. This connection suggests that just as an adoptee is chosen by a family to become part of it, a selection option is chosen from a range of possibilities. The underlying dynamic here is the concept of *choice* and *inclusion*.

- The candidates in the source frame are metaphorically connected to the options in the target frame. This connection implies that just as candidates are potential adoptees waiting to be chosen, options are potential selections waiting to be made. This connection underscores the concept of *potentiality* and *availability*.

- The family_representative in the source frame is metaphorically connected to the selector in the target frame. This connection suggests that just as a family representative makes the decision to adopt, a selector makes the decision to choose a particular option. The underlying dynamic here is the concept of *decision-making* and *authority*.

The metaphor SELECTION_IS_ADOPTION encapsulates the dynamics of decision-making, choice, and inclusion. Just as a family representative carefully considers various candidates before adopting an adoptee, a selector carefully considers various options before making a selection. This metaphor also implies a sense of *commitment* and *responsibility* as adopting a child is not a decision taken lightly, and similarly, making a selection often involves a commitment to the chosen option.

The example ""They adopted the customs of their neighbors Jisup"" illustrates this metaphor by showing how the act of adopting customs is akin to making a selection from a range of possible behaviors or practices. This example highlights the concepts of *cultural adaptation* and *integration* as well.

In summary, the metaphor SELECTION_IS_ADOPTION is rich in concepts such as *choice*, *potentiality*, *decision-making*, *authority*, *commitment*, *responsibility*, *cultural adaptation*, and *integration*.";"choice; inclusion; potentiality; availability; decision-making; authority; commitment; responsibility; cultural adaptation; integration; choice; potentiality; decision-making; authority; commitment; responsibility; cultural adaptation; integration"

This metaphorical mapping suggests that the process of initiating and undergoing a personal change is conceptually similar to the act of moving oneself towards a destination.

The source roles include self-motion_x-schema, path, source, self-mover, and goal. The target roles include self-initiated_change_x-schema, transition, initial_state, experiencer, and final_state.

The *self-motion_x-schema* in the source frame maps onto the *self-initiated_change_x-schema* in the target frame. This suggests that the act of moving oneself (self-motion) is metaphorically linked to the process of initiating and undergoing a change (self-initiated change). Both involve *agency* and *self-determination*, as the individual is the primary actor in both scenarios.

The *path* in the source frame corresponds to the *transition* in the target frame. This implies that the journey or route taken in self-propelled motion is conceptually similar to the process of transition during a self-initiated state change. Both signify a *process* or *progression* from one state to another.

The *source* in the source frame maps onto the *initial_state* in the target frame. This suggests that the starting point of a journey is metaphorically similar to the initial state before a change. Both represent the *beginning* or *status quo* before the initiation of movement or change.

The *self-mover* in the source frame corresponds to the *experiencer* in the target frame. This implies that the individual who propels themselves in motion is conceptually similar to the individual who experiences a state change. Both roles highlight the *subject* who is actively involved in the process.

Lastly, the *goal* in the source frame maps onto the *final_state* in the target frame. This suggests that the destination of a journey is metaphorically similar to the final state after a change. Both represent the *end point* or *desired outcome* of the process.

The example ""She climbed out of poverty"" illustrates this metaphor. Here, the act of climbing (self-propelled motion) is used to represent the woman's self-initiated change from a state of poverty (initial state) to a better economic condition (final state). The metaphor captures the dynamics of *struggle*, *effort*, and *aspiration* involved in such a transformative process.";"self-motion_x-schema; self-initiated_change_x-schema; agency; self-determination; path; transition; process; progression; source; initial_state; beginning; status quo; self-mover; experiencer; subject; goal; final_state; end point; desired outcome; struggle; effort; aspiration"
150;SEQUENCE_OF_ACTIONS_IS_A_SEQUENCE_OF_MOVEMENTS;Motion_along_a_path;Action;moving_entity;acting_entity;Create a complete measurable action plan which includes all the steps necessary to achieve your goal;"In the metaphor SEQUENCE_OF_ACTIONS_IS_A_SEQUENCE_OF_MOVEMENTS, the source frame is Motion_along_a_path and the target frame is Action. The source role is the moving_entity, which corresponds to the target role of the acting_entity.

The metaphorical connection between these roles is that the *moving entity* in the source frame is metaphorically mapped onto the *acting entity* in the target frame. This suggests that the process of moving along a path is conceptually similar to the process of performing a sequence of actions.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the concept of *progression*. Just as a moving entity progresses along a path, an acting entity progresses through a sequence of actions. This progression is not random but follows a specific order or plan, which is implied in the example sentence: ""Create a complete measurable action plan which includes all the steps necessary to achieve your goal"".

Another key concept in this metaphor is *directionality*. In both frames, there is a clear direction from the starting point to the end point. The moving entity moves from one location to another along a path, while the acting entity moves from one action to another in a sequence. This implies that actions, like movements, are not isolated events but are interconnected and lead towards a specific goal.

The metaphor also suggests a concept of *effort* or *energy expenditure*. Just as moving along a path requires physical effort, performing a sequence of actions requires mental or physical effort. This connection highlights the active nature of both roles and the necessity of exerting energy to achieve a goal.

Finally, the metaphor implies a concept of *navigation*. The moving entity needs to navigate the path, while the acting entity needs to navigate through the sequence of actions. This suggests that both roles require a certain level of skill, knowledge, or competence to successfully reach their destination or achieve their goal.

In summary, the metaphor SEQUENCE_OF_ACTIONS_IS_A_SEQUENCE_OF_MOVEMENTS encapsulates the concepts of *progression*, *directionality*, *effort*, and *navigation*. These concepts provide a deeper understanding of the metaphorical connections between the roles in the source and target frames.";"moving entity; acting entity; progression; directionality; effort; energy expenditure; navigation; progression; directionality; effort; navigation"
151;SICKNESS_IS_DOWN;Being_at_a_Low_Location;Health;supine_entity;sick_entity;"He's sinking fast ; He came down with the flu";"In the metaphor SICKNESS_IS_DOWN, the source frame is Being_at_a_Low_Location and the target frame is Health. The source role is the supine_entity, which metaphorically corresponds to the target role of the sick_entity.

The metaphorical connection between these roles is based on the conceptual tie of *verticality*, where being in a low position is metaphorically linked to the state of being unwell or sick. This metaphor is deeply rooted in our physical and cultural experiences, where being upright is associated with health and vitality, while being down or low is linked to weakness or illness.

The examples 'He's sinking fast' and 'He's come down with the flu' illustrate this metaphorical connection. In both cases, the downward movement or position is used to describe the onset or progression of illness.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve several key concepts. The first is the concept of *gravity*, which pulls things down. In the metaphor, this can be seen as the force of the illness pulling the person down, making them weak and unable to resist.

The second concept is *control and lack thereof*. When someone is standing, they have control over their movement and direction. But when someone is lying down or sinking, they have lost control, much like when they are sick and their body is not functioning as it should.

The third concept is *visibility and invisibility*. When someone is standing, they are visible and present. But when they are down, they become less visible, much like when they are sick and unable to participate in normal activities.

The fourth concept is *struggle and surrender*. Standing up requires effort and struggle, while lying down or sinking involves surrender, much like the struggle to stay healthy and the surrender to illness.

These concepts of *gravity*, *control and lack thereof*, *visibility and invisibility*, and *struggle and surrender* provide a deeper understanding of the metaphor SICKNESS_IS_DOWN, showing how it captures the physical and emotional experiences of illness.";"verticality; gravity; control and lack thereof; visibility and invisibility; struggle and surrender; gravity; control and lack thereof; visibility and invisibility; struggle and surrender"

The metaphorical connections between roles in the source frame and those in the target frame are as follows:

- The source role of fibers is metaphorically connected to the target role of member_relation. Fibers are the individual threads that, when woven together, create a fabric. Similarly, in a social group, individual members and their relationships with each other form the collective entity. This connection highlights the concept of *interdependence* and *unity*. Just as fibers alone do not constitute a fabric, individual members without relationships do not form a social group.

- The source role of textile_whole is metaphorically connected to the target role of social_group_whole. A textile is a complete fabric made up of interwoven fibers, and a social group is a collective entity made up of interrelated members. This connection underscores the concept of *collectivity* and *cohesion*. Just as a textile is a unified whole, a social group is a cohesive entity.

The examples provided further illustrate these metaphorical connections. The phrase ""Cop scandals fray the social fabric"" uses the metaphor of a fraying fabric to describe the damaging effect of police scandals on the cohesion and unity of society. This suggests the concept of *vulnerability* and *damage*. Just as a fabric can be frayed or torn, a social group can be damaged by scandals or conflicts.

The phrase ""Thus we must reweave the torn fabric of rural American with thread strong enough to withstand the inevitable ravages of time"" uses the metaphor of reweaving a torn fabric to describe the need to rebuild and strengthen rural American communities. This suggests the concepts of *repair*, *resilience*, and *reconstruction*. Just as a torn fabric can be rewoven, a damaged social group can be repaired and made stronger.

In both examples, the metaphor of a fabric is used to convey the dynamics of social groups, emphasizing the importance of unity, cohesion, and resilience in the face of challenges.";"interdependence; unity; collectivity; cohesion; vulnerability; damage; repair; resilience; reconstruction"
153;SOCIAL_ORGANIZATIONS_ARE_PLANTS;Plants;Organization;plant_entity;organization_whole;My business is growing like a weed;"In the metaphor SOCIAL_ORGANIZATIONS_ARE_PLANTS, the source frame is Plants and the target frame is Organization. The source role is plant_entity and the target role is organization_whole. The example given is ""My business is growing like a weed.""

The metaphorical connections between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame can be analyzed as follows:

1. *Growth*: In the source frame, plants grow from a seed to a mature plant, often going through stages of germination, growth, and maturation. This is metaphorically connected to the growth of an organization in the target frame, which can start from a small startup and grow into a large corporation. The growth of a plant is a natural, organic process that requires nurturing, just like the growth of an organization requires effort, resources, and time.

2. *Life Cycle*: Just as plants have a life cycle - from seed to sprout, to maturity, and eventually death - organizations also have a life cycle. They are founded, they grow, they mature, and eventually, they may decline or be dissolved. This life cycle is a key conceptual tie between the two frames.

3. *Environment*: Plants are heavily influenced by their environment - the soil, the weather, the availability of sunlight and water. Similarly, organizations are influenced by their environment - the market conditions, the regulatory environment, the socio-economic factors. This highlights the *adaptability* and *resilience* required in both frames.

4. *Diversity & Variation*: Just as there are many different types of plants, each with its own unique characteristics and needs, there are many different types of organizations, each with its own unique culture, structure, and goals. This diversity and variation is another key conceptual tie between the two frames.

5. *Weeds vs. Cultivated Plants*: The example given specifically mentions a business growing ""like a weed"". This introduces the concept of *uncontrolled growth* or *invasive growth*, which can be both positive (rapid expansion) and negative (overstretching resources, lack of control). This contrasts with the growth of a cultivated plant, which is carefully managed and controlled.

6. *Nurturing & Care*: Plants require care, including watering, pruning, and protection from pests. Similarly, organizations require care in the form of management, investment, and protection from various risks. This nurturing and care is a key conceptual tie between the two frames.

7. *Fruitfulness & Productivity*: Just as mature plants bear fruit or flowers, mature organizations are expected to be productive and profitable. This concept of fruitfulness and productivity is another key conceptual tie between the two frames.";"Growth; Life Cycle; Environment; adaptability; resilience; Diversity & Variation; Weeds vs. Cultivated Plants; uncontrolled growth; invasive growth; Nurturing & Care; Fruitfulness & Productivity"

This metaphorical connection suggests that social problems are viewed as diseases that infect society, similar to how diseases infect a body.

The *disease* in the source frame corresponds to the *problem* in the target frame. This implies that just like a disease, a social problem is a harmful condition that negatively affects the functioning of society.

The *diseased_cell* in the source frame corresponds to the *immoral_citizen* in the target frame. This suggests that individuals who contribute to social problems are likened to diseased cells that harm the body.

The *healthy_cell* in the source frame corresponds to the *honest_citizen* in the target frame. This implies that honest citizens are seen as healthy cells that contribute positively to the functioning of society.

The *bodily_healing_system* in the source frame corresponds to the *social_program* in the target frame. This suggests that social programs are seen as the body's healing system, working to combat and resolve social problems.

The *doctor* in the source frame corresponds to the *authority* in the target frame. This implies that authorities are seen as doctors who diagnose and treat social problems.

The *person* in the source frame corresponds to the *society* in the target frame. This suggests that society as a whole is seen as a person, with social problems affecting its overall health and wellbeing.

The *health_status* in the source frame corresponds to the *social_functioning* in the target frame. This implies that the overall functioning of society is seen as its health status, with social problems seen as diseases that negatively affect this status.

This metaphorical connection highlights the conceptual ties between diseases and social problems, suggesting that social problems can be understood, diagnosed, and treated in a similar way to diseases. It also implies that just like a disease, a social problem can spread and affect the overall health and functioning of society. This metaphor encompasses nuances such as *diagnosis & treatment*, *spread & containment*, and *prevention & recovery*.";"disease; problem; diseased_cell; immoral_citizen; healthy_cell; honest_citizen; bodily_healing_system; social_program; doctor; authority; person; society; health_status; social_functioning; diagnosis & treatment; spread & containment; prevention & recovery"

The roles in the source frame, such as patient, symptoms, and affliction, are metaphorically linked to the roles in the target frame, namely society, result_of_problem, and social_problem.

The *patient* in the source frame corresponds to *society* in the target frame. This suggests that society, like a patient, is seen as a recipient of afflictions, which in this case are social problems. This implies a sense of *vulnerability* and *susceptibility* of society to various social issues, similar to how a patient is susceptible to diseases.

The *symptoms* in the source frame are linked to the *result_of_problem* in the target frame. This implies that the effects or outcomes of social problems are viewed as symptoms, indicating the presence of an underlying issue. This connection highlights the concept of *diagnosis*, where symptoms are identified and analyzed to understand the root cause, much like diagnosing a disease based on its symptoms.

The *affliction* in the source frame corresponds to the *social_problem* in the target frame. This suggests that social problems are perceived as diseases or afflictions that harm society. This connection underscores the concept of *harm and damage* that both physical afflictions and social problems can cause.

The example provided, ""A cure for social ills... prevention techniques can pay off in curing social problems"", further illustrates this metaphor. Here, the idea of *curing* social problems through prevention techniques mirrors the process of treating physical diseases, emphasizing the concepts of *treatment* and *prevention*. This metaphor suggests that, like physical afflictions, social problems can be addressed and potentially cured through appropriate interventions.

In summary, this metaphor encapsulates several key concepts: *vulnerability* of society, *diagnosis* of social problems through their symptoms, *harm and damage* caused by these problems, and the possibility of their *treatment* and *prevention*. It highlights the parallels between addressing physical diseases and tackling social issues, suggesting that strategies effective in one domain might be applicable in the other.";"patient; society; vulnerability; susceptibility; symptoms; result_of_problem; diagnosis; affliction; social_problem; harm and damage; curing; treatment; prevention; vulnerability; diagnosis; harm and damage; treatment; prevention"
156;STATE_OF_NATION_IS_LOCATION_ALONG_PATH;Bounded_region;Nation;interior;state_of_nation;"East Timor took the first steps toward independence in the 1990s ; The country is slowly moving out of recession";"In the metaphor STATE_OF_NATION_IS_LOCATION_ALONG_PATH, the source frame is Bounded_region, with the role of interior, and the target frame is Nation, with the role of state_of_nation. The metaphorical connection between these roles is that the *state of a nation* is conceptualized as a *location along a path* within a bounded region.

The first example, ""East Timor took the first steps toward independence in the 1990s"", illustrates this metaphor by representing the nation's progress towards independence as a journey along a path. The *steps* metaphorically represent the actions or policies implemented by the nation to achieve independence. The *path* represents the process or timeline of achieving independence, and the *bounded region* is the political, social, and economic context within which this process takes place.

The second example, ""The country is slowly moving out of recession"", also uses this metaphor to depict the nation's economic recovery as a movement along a path. The *slow movement* metaphorically represents the gradual improvement in the nation's economic conditions. The *path* represents the economic timeline, and the *bounded region* is the economic context within which this recovery takes place.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the concepts of *progression* and *directionality*. Just as one moves along a path in a certain direction to reach a destination, a nation progresses in a certain direction to achieve a particular state. This metaphor also encompasses nuances such as *pace of movement* (representing the speed of change in the nation's state), *obstacles along the path* (representing challenges faced by the nation), and *distance covered or remaining* (representing the extent of progress made or yet to be made).

This metaphor also implicitly suggests that the state of a nation is not static but dynamic and subject to change, just like a location along a path. It also implies that the nation has some control over its state, as it can choose which direction to move in and at what pace, just like a traveler deciding his route and speed.";"state of a nation; location along a path; steps; path; bounded region; slow movement; path; bounded region; progression; directionality; pace of movement; obstacles along the path; distance covered or remaining"
157;SUBJUGATION_IS_DOWN;Verticality;Control;vertically_lower_entity;subjugated_entity;"He is under my control ; He fell from power ; His power is on the decline";"In the metaphor SUBJUGATION_IS_DOWN, the source frame is Verticality and the target frame is Control. The source role is the vertically_lower_entity and the target role is the subjugated_entity. This metaphor is based on the conceptualization of power dynamics and control in terms of vertical positioning, where being in a lower position is metaphorically linked to being subjugated or under control.

The metaphorical connection between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame is that the vertically_lower_entity is metaphorically mapped onto the subjugated_entity. This implies that the *lower* a person or entity is in the verticality frame, the more they are *controlled* or *subjugated* in the control frame.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the concept of *dominance* and *submission*, which are often conceptualized in terms of vertical positioning. The higher position is associated with dominance, power, and control, while the lower position is associated with submission, weakness, and being controlled. This metaphorical mapping is deeply ingrained in our cognitive and cultural schemas, as evidenced by phrases like ""looking up to someone"" or ""being under someone's thumb"".

The metaphor also involves the concept of *change in status*, as indicated by the examples ""He fell from power"" and ""His power is on the decline"". These phrases suggest a downward movement, which metaphorically represents a loss of power or control. This ties in with the concept of *instability*, as power dynamics can shift and change over time.

Finally, the metaphor also implies a sense of *constraint* or *restriction*. Being ""under"" someone's control suggests a lack of freedom or autonomy, which is metaphorically represented by the lower position in the verticality frame. This concept of constraint is a key aspect of the subjugation/control dynamic.

In summary, the metaphor SUBJUGATION_IS_DOWN involves several key concepts, including *dominance/submission*, *change in status*, *instability*, and *constraint*. These concepts are metaphorically mapped onto a verticality schema, where a lower position represents subjugation or control.";"lower; controlled; subjugated; dominance; submission; change in status; instability; constraint; restriction; dominance/submission; change in status; instability; constraint"

The source role is the ""burden"" or ""burdened_entity"", while the target role is the ""tax"" or ""tax_payer"". The metaphorical connection between these roles is that taxation is perceived as a weight or burden that is carried by the tax payer, much like a physical load.

The conceptual ties between these roles are numerous. Firstly, there is the concept of *weight*, which is inherent in the idea of a burden. This weight is transferred metaphorically to the concept of taxation, suggesting that taxes are a heavy load that individuals or entities must carry.

Secondly, there is the concept of *responsibility*. In the same way that a burdened entity is responsible for carrying a physical load, a tax payer is responsible for paying their taxes. This responsibility can be seen as a form of obligation or duty, which adds to the perceived weight of the tax burden.

Thirdly, there is the concept of *strain or stress*. Just as carrying a heavy burden can cause physical strain or stress, paying taxes can cause financial strain or stress. This strain can be exacerbated by factors such as the amount of tax, the frequency of tax payments, and the individual's or entity's financial situation.

Finally, there is the concept of *relief*. Just as a burden can be lightened or removed, resulting in relief, the tax burden can also be reduced or eliminated, leading to financial relief. This can occur through tax cuts, tax credits, or other forms of tax relief.

In summary, the metaphor TAXATION_IS_A_BURDEN conceptualizes taxation as a weighty responsibility that can cause strain or stress, but from which relief is possible. This metaphor not only captures the physicality of carrying a burden, but also the emotional and psychological aspects of dealing with a heavy load.";"weight; responsibility; strain or stress; relief"
159;TAXATION_IS_CAUSING_HARM;Physical_harm;Taxation;"harmful_effect;victim;agent";"tax_payment;tax_payer;taxer";"High sales taxes hurt local small businesses; We are being taxed to death!";"In the metaphor TAXATION_IS_CAUSING_HARM, the source frame is Physical_harm and the target frame is Taxation. The metaphorical connections between roles in the source frame and those in the target frame are as follows:

1. The harmful_effect in the source frame corresponds to the tax_payment in the target frame. This suggests that the act of paying taxes is seen as causing harm or damage, similar to a physical injury. The underlying dynamic here is the *burden* or *strain* that tax payments can impose on individuals or businesses, particularly when the taxes are high or disproportionate. This can be likened to the physical pain or discomfort caused by an injury.

2. The victim in the source frame corresponds to the tax_payer in the target frame. This implies that the person or entity paying the taxes is perceived as being harmed or victimized, similar to a person who suffers physical harm. The underlying dynamic here is the *vulnerability* and *disadvantage* experienced by the tax payer, especially when they are unable to afford the taxes or when the taxes are perceived as unfair. This can be compared to the vulnerability of a person who is physically harmed.

3. The agent in the source frame corresponds to the taxer in the target frame. This suggests that the entity imposing the taxes is seen as causing harm, similar to a person who inflicts physical harm on another. The underlying dynamic here is the *power imbalance* between the taxer and the tax payer, with the taxer having the authority to impose taxes and the tax payer being obligated to pay them. This can be likened to the power imbalance between an aggressor and a victim in a situation of physical harm.

The examples provided, ""High sales taxes hurt local small businesses"" and ""We are being taxed to death!"", further illustrate these metaphorical connections. They depict taxation as a harmful force that can damage businesses and individuals, reinforcing the conceptual ties between *physical harm* and *taxation*. The phrase ""being taxed to death"" particularly emphasizes the severity of the harm, suggesting a level of taxation that is not just damaging but potentially lethal, metaphorically speaking. This highlights the *intensity* and *extremity* of the perceived harm caused by taxation.";"burden; strain; vulnerability; disadvantage; power imbalance; physical harm; taxation; intensity; extremity"
160;TAXATION_IS_PUNISHMENT;Punishmen;Taxation;"punishment;punished_person;punisher";"tax;tax_payer;taxer";The state cannot pay its bills and poorly educates its young and its taxation punishes whatever success that its suffocating regulatory regime does not prevent;"In the metaphor TAXATION_IS_PUNISHMENT, the source frame is Punishment and the target frame is Taxation. The metaphorical connections between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame are as follows:

- The role of *punishment* in the source frame is connected to the role of *tax* in the target frame. This suggests that taxation is viewed as a form of punishment, a negative consequence or burden that is imposed. This connection implies a *burden* or *hardship* that is associated with taxation, similar to the discomfort or suffering that is associated with punishment.

- The role of *punished person* in the source frame is connected to the role of *tax payer* in the target frame. This implies that the person who is being taxed is seen as the one being punished. This connection suggests a sense of *victimhood* or *unfair treatment* experienced by the tax payer, similar to the feelings of a person who is being punished.

- The role of *punisher* in the source frame is connected to the role of *taxer* in the target frame. This suggests that the entity imposing the tax is seen as the punisher. This connection implies a sense of *authority* and *control* exerted by the taxer, similar to the power dynamics between a punisher and the punished.

The example provided further illustrates these connections. The state, as the taxer, is portrayed as a punisher that cannot pay its bills and poorly educates its young. Its taxation, as a form of punishment, is seen as stifling success and imposing hardship. The tax payer, in this case, is portrayed as a victim of this punitive system.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve concepts of *power imbalance*, *oppression*, and *unfairness*. It suggests a critique of taxation as a system that unfairly burdens individuals and stifles success, rather than serving as a fair means of funding public services. This metaphor also implies a sense of *resistance* or *resentment* towards taxation, similar to the resistance one might feel towards unjust punishment.";"punishment; tax; burden; hardship; punished person; tax payer; victimhood; unfair treatment; punisher; taxer; authority; control; power imbalance; oppression; unfairness; resistance; resentment"
161;TAXATION_IS_SLAVERY;Servitude;Taxation;"subjugated;subjugator";"tax_payer;taxer";America Tax Slaves Work 65 Months Every Year to Pay for Government;"In the metaphor TAXATION_IS_SLAVERY, the source frame is Servitude, and the target frame is Taxation. The roles in the source frame are the subjugated and the subjugator, which correspond to the tax payer and the taxer in the target frame.

The metaphorical connection between these roles is based on the perceived power dynamics and the concept of *obligation*. In the source frame, the subjugated is under the control of the subjugator, similar to how a slave is controlled by their master. This is paralleled in the target frame where the tax payer, like the subjugated, is under the control of the taxer (the government, in this case). The tax payer is obligated to pay taxes, much like a slave is obligated to serve their master.

The metaphor also implies a sense of *unfairness* and *exploitation*. In the source frame, the subjugated is exploited by the subjugator, who benefits from their labor without providing fair compensation. This is mirrored in the target frame where the tax payer is seen as being exploited by the taxer, who takes a portion of their income without providing a perceived fair return in services or benefits.

Another key concept in this metaphor is *lack of freedom*. In the source frame, the subjugated lacks freedom due to their servitude. This is paralleled in the target frame where the tax payer, despite living in a free society, lacks financial freedom due to the obligation to pay taxes.

The metaphor also suggests a sense of *endurance* and *resilience*. The subjugated, despite their circumstances, continues to work and survive, much like the tax payer who, despite the perceived burden of taxes, continues to work and fulfill their obligations.

In summary, the metaphor TAXATION_IS_SLAVERY draws on the concepts of *obligation*, *unfairness*, *exploitation*, *lack of freedom*, and *endurance* to draw parallels between the roles of the subjugated and the tax payer, and the subjugator and the taxer.";"obligation; unfairness; exploitation; lack of freedom; endurance; resilience; obligation; unfairness; exploitation; lack of freedom; endurance"
162;TAXATION_IS_THEFT;Theft;Taxation;"stolen_item;victim;thief";"tax;tax_payer;taxer";Government steals the people's wealth through overt and hidden taxes ;"In the metaphor TAXATION_IS_THEFT, the source frame is ""Theft"" and the target frame is ""Taxation"". The roles in the source frame are ""stolen_item"", ""victim"", and ""thief"", while the roles in the target frame are ""tax"", ""tax_payer"", and ""taxer"".

The metaphorical connections between the roles in the source and target frames can be understood as follows:

1. The ""stolen_item"" in the source frame corresponds to the ""tax"" in the target frame. This suggests that the *money* collected through taxation is perceived as something *taken away* without the consent of the owner, similar to a stolen item.

2. The ""victim"" in the source frame corresponds to the ""tax_payer"" in the target frame. This implies that the tax payer is seen as the *victim* of the theft, the one who *loses* something valuable (money) without their full agreement or understanding.

3. The ""thief"" in the source frame corresponds to the ""taxer"" in the target frame. This suggests that the entity imposing the tax (usually the government) is viewed as the *thief*, the one who *takes away* the valuable item (money) from the victim (tax payer).

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the concepts of *involuntary loss*, *power imbalance*, and *unfairness*. The metaphor portrays taxation as an act of theft, implying that it is an involuntary and unjust process where the powerful (the taxer or government) takes from the less powerful (the tax payer). This perspective emphasizes the *coercive* nature of taxation, viewing it as a form of *exploitation* rather than a necessary contribution to societal functions and services.

It's important to note that this metaphor reflects a specific viewpoint on taxation and doesn't represent all perspectives. For some, taxation might be seen as a *duty* or *responsibility* rather than theft, contributing to the *common good* and *social welfare*. However, the TAXATION_IS_THEFT metaphor highlights the feelings of *resentment* and *injustice* that some individuals or groups may associate with the process of taxation.";"money; taken away; victim; loses; thief; takes away; involuntary loss; power imbalance; unfairness; coercive; exploitation; duty; responsibility; common good; social welfare; resentment; injustice"
163;TAXES_ARE_DISEASES;Disease;Taxation;"disease;patient";"tax;tax_payer";"During a panel discussion that included Washington Governor Christine Gregoire and Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval Brown accused California lawmakers of adhering to 'the notion that taxes are like some kind of sexually transmitted disease' the Los Angeles Times reports ; Those insidious taxes infect every aspect of our lives";"In the metaphor TAXES_ARE_DISEASES, the source frame is Disease, with the roles of disease and patient, and the target frame is Taxation, with the roles of tax and tax_payer. The metaphorical connection between these roles is that taxes (the disease) are imposed on tax_payers (the patients), causing them discomfort or harm.

The metaphorical connection between the disease and tax is that both are seen as *burdens* or *afflictions*. Just as diseases can cause physical discomfort and distress, taxes can cause financial stress and burden. This connection is highlighted in the example where taxes are described as ""insidious"" and ""infecting every aspect of our lives"". The use of the word ""insidious"" suggests that taxes, like diseases, are harmful and damaging. The phrase ""infect every aspect of our lives"" further strengthens this connection by suggesting that taxes, like diseases, are pervasive and unavoidable.

The connection between the patient and the tax_payer is that both are the *recipients* of the affliction. Just as patients suffer from diseases, tax_payers bear the burden of taxes. This connection is highlighted in the example where California lawmakers are accused of viewing taxes as a sexually transmitted disease. This suggests that tax_payers, like patients, are victims of an unwanted and harmful condition.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the concepts of *imposition* and *suffering*. In both diseases and taxation, there is an external force (the disease or the tax) that is imposed on an individual (the patient or the tax_payer), causing them to suffer. This metaphor also encompasses nuances such as *resistance & avoidance*, as both patients and tax_payers often seek to avoid or minimize their affliction, and *inevitability & persistence*, as both diseases and taxes are often seen as unavoidable aspects of life.";"burdens; afflictions; recipients; imposition; suffering; resistance & avoidance; inevitability & persistence"
164;TAXES_ARE_DUES;Group_membership;Taxation;"membership_fee;member";"tax_payment;tax_payer";Taxes after all are dues that we pay for the privileges of membership in an organized society quote from Franklin D Roosevelt cited on:;"In the metaphor TAXES_ARE_DUES, the source frame is Group_membership, and the target frame is Taxation. The roles in the source frame are membership_fee and member, while in the target frame, they are tax_payment and tax_payer.

The metaphorical connection between these roles is based on the conceptual ties of *obligation*, *participation*, and *benefits*. In a group membership, a member is obligated to pay a membership fee to participate in the group and enjoy its benefits. Similarly, in taxation, a tax payer is obligated to make a tax payment to participate in the society and enjoy its benefits.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the concept of *social contract*. Just as a member agrees to pay dues to support the group and in return, receives certain privileges, a tax payer agrees to pay taxes to support the functioning of the society and in return, receives public services and infrastructure.

This metaphor also brings out the concept of *collective responsibility*. In a group, all members share the responsibility of maintaining the group through their dues. Similarly, in a society, all tax payers share the responsibility of maintaining the society through their taxes.

The metaphor also highlights the concept of *reciprocity*. In a group, the member gives dues and receives benefits. In a society, the tax payer gives taxes and receives public services.

Finally, the metaphor underscores the concept of *citizenship*. Just as being a member implies belonging to a group, being a tax payer implies belonging to a society. This metaphor thus frames taxes not as a burden, but as a dues that citizens pay for the privileges of membership in an organized society.

In summary, the metaphor TAXES_ARE_DUES encapsulates the concepts of *obligation*, *participation*, *benefits*, *social contract*, *collective responsibility*, *reciprocity*, and *citizenship*.";"obligation; participation; benefits; social contract; collective responsibility; reciprocity; citizenship; obligation; participation; benefits; social contract; collective responsibility; reciprocity; citizenship"

Only those dummies not in a state of denial understand that we the people have lost control of our government; But meanwhile you may not have noticed that our government gave away control of the Internet";"In the metaphor TERMINATION_OF_CONTROL_IS_LOSS_OF_A_POSSESSION, the source frame is ""Lose_possession"" and the target frame is ""Control"". The metaphorical connection between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame is that the act of losing possession (source role) is conceptually linked to the termination of control (target role).

The source role ""possession"" is metaphorically connected to the target role ""ability_to_control"". This suggests that *control* is viewed as a form of *possession*, something that can be owned, held, or lost. The source role ""lose_possession_x-schema.finish"" is linked to ""control_relation_status.finish"", indicating that the end of possession is seen as the end of control. The source role ""donor"" is connected to ""controlling_entity"", suggesting that the entity that gives away or loses possession is the one that loses control.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the concepts of *ownership* and *authority*. In the same way that losing a physical possession results in a loss of ownership and authority over that item, losing control is seen as a loss of ownership and authority over a situation, entity, or process. This metaphor also implies a sense of *power* and *dominance*; to control something is to possess it, to have power and dominance over it.

The metaphor also encompasses nuances such as *responsibility* and *accountability*. When one has control or possession, they are responsible and accountable for what happens to it. Losing control or possession, therefore, implies a relinquishment of these responsibilities and accountabilities.

The examples provided illustrate this metaphor in action. In the context of government and politics, the metaphor suggests that the people, or the ""controlling_entity"", have lost control or ""ability_to_control"" their government, likening it to losing a possession. Similarly, the government giving away control of the internet is seen as a loss of a possession.

In summary, the metaphor TERMINATION_OF_CONTROL_IS_LOSS_OF_A_POSSESSION conceptualizes the loss of control as a loss of possession, highlighting the intertwined dynamics of ownership, authority, power, dominance, responsibility, and accountability.";"control; possession; ownership; authority; power; dominance; responsibility; accountability"

The source roles are ""building_foundation"", ""building_whole"", and ""building_parts"", which correspond to the target roles ""theory_supporting_evidence"", ""theoretical_domain"", and ""theoretical_arguments"" respectively.

The metaphorical connections between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame are as follows:

1. ""Building_foundation"" is metaphorically connected to ""theory_supporting_evidence"". This suggests that just as a building's foundation provides the necessary support and stability for the structure, the supporting evidence in a theory provides the basis and validity for the theoretical claims. This connection highlights the concept of *stability* and *support*.

2. ""Building_whole"" is metaphorically connected to ""theoretical_domain"". This implies that a theory, like a building, is a coherent whole that encompasses a specific domain or area of knowledge. This connection underscores the concept of *comprehensiveness* and *boundaries*.

3. ""Building_parts"" is metaphorically connected to ""theoretical_arguments"". This suggests that just as a building is composed of various parts that together form a coherent structure, a theory is made up of various arguments that together form a coherent explanation or interpretation. This connection highlights the concept of *composition* and *integration*.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the comparison of the abstract process of formulating and understanding theories to the concrete process of constructing and understanding buildings. This metaphor not only simplifies the abstract process but also adds depth to our understanding by highlighting the importance of a solid foundation (supporting evidence), the coherence of the whole (theoretical domain), and the integration of the parts (theoretical arguments) in both processes.

Key concepts in this metaphor include *stability*, *support*, *comprehensiveness*, *boundaries*, *composition*, and *integration*. These concepts are not merely rewordings of the given information but are extracted from the metaphorical connections between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame.";"stability; support; comprehensiveness; boundaries; composition; integration; stability; support; comprehensiveness; boundaries; composition; integration"
167;THINKING_IS_OBJECT_MANIPULATION;Object_manipulation;Thinking_about;objects;ideas;Let's toss some ideas around;"In the metaphor THINKING_IS_OBJECT_MANIPULATION, the source frame is Object_manipulation, and the target frame is Thinking_about. The source role is objects, and the target role is ideas. The example given is 'Let's toss some ideas around Elise'.

The metaphorical connection between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame is that *ideas* are being treated as *objects* that can be manipulated. This metaphor suggests that thinking is a process of manipulating ideas, similar to how one might manipulate physical objects.

The conceptual ties between these roles are rooted in the *active engagement* and *dynamic interaction* involved in both object manipulation and thinking. Just as one can move, rearrange, or transform objects, one can also manipulate ideas by considering them from different perspectives, combining them in new ways, or breaking them down into smaller components.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the concept of *cognitive flexibility* and *creativity*. In object manipulation, there is a need for adaptability and skill to handle objects in various ways. Similarly, in thinking, there is a need for cognitive flexibility to manipulate ideas effectively.

Moreover, the metaphor also implies a sense of *collective brainstorming* or *collaboration*. The phrase 'Let's toss some ideas around Elise' suggests a group activity where ideas are being shared and discussed, similar to how objects might be passed around in a group.

Finally, the metaphor also encompasses the concept of *experimentation*. Just as one might experiment with different ways of manipulating an object to achieve a desired result, one might also experiment with different ways of thinking about an idea to gain new insights or solve a problem.

In summary, the metaphor THINKING_IS_OBJECT_MANIPULATION encapsulates the concepts of *active engagement*, *dynamic interaction*, *cognitive flexibility*, *creativity*, *collective brainstorming*, and *experimentation*.";"ideas; objects; active engagement; dynamic interaction; cognitive flexibility; creativity; collective brainstorming; collaboration; experimentation; active engagement; dynamic interaction; cognitive flexibility; creativity; collective brainstorming; experimentation"
168;THINKING_IS_SPEAKING;Speaking;Cognizing;"topic;speaker";"topic;cognizer";"I can barely hear myself think ; He's an articulate thinke; She doesn't listen to her conscience ; That sounds like a good idea";"The metaphor THINKING_IS_SPEAKING is a conceptual mapping that links the process of thinking (TargetFrame: Cognizing) to the act of speaking (SourceFrame: Speaking). The metaphorical connections between roles in the source frame and those in the target frame are as follows: the 'speaker' in the source frame corresponds to the 'cognizer' in the target frame, and the 'topic' in the source frame corresponds to the 'topic' in the target frame.

The metaphor suggests that *internal cognitive processes* are akin to *external verbal expressions*. This metaphorical connection implies that thinking, like speaking, is a *communicative act*, albeit one that occurs internally. It suggests that thoughts are not static, but dynamic and evolving, much like a conversation.

The examples provided further illustrate this metaphorical connection. ""I can barely hear myself think"" suggests that thoughts can be 'heard' internally, much like spoken words. ""He's an articulate thinker"" implies that the clarity and coherence of thoughts can be compared to the eloquence of speech. ""She doesn't listen to her conscience"" suggests that our conscience 'speaks' to us, and we 'listen' to it in our minds. ""That sounds like a good idea"" implies that ideas can 'sound' good or bad, much like spoken words can.

This metaphor also highlights the *active role* of the cognizer, paralleling the speaker's role in a conversation. Just as the speaker chooses words and constructs sentences, the cognizer actively processes information, forms ideas, and makes decisions.

Moreover, the metaphor implies a *reflective aspect* to thinking. Just as a speaker listens to their own words, a thinker 'listens' to their own thoughts, reflecting on them and adjusting them as necessary. This can be seen in the example ""I can barely hear myself think"", which suggests a feedback loop between 'speaking' (thinking) and 'listening' (reflecting).

In summary, the metaphor THINKING_IS_SPEAKING encapsulates several key concepts: *communication*, *dynamism*, *activity*, and *reflection*. It portrays thinking as a communicative, active, and reflective process, akin to speaking.";"internal cognitive processes; external verbal expressions; communicative act; active role; reflective aspect; communication; dynamism; activity; reflection"

The metaphorical connections between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame are as follows:

1. The *space_in_front_of_observer* in the source frame corresponds to *future_time* in the target frame. This connection implies that the future is something that lies ahead of us, something we are moving towards. It suggests that we are *actively approaching* the future, just as we would approach a landscape that lies in front of us. This connection also implies a sense of *anticipation* and *preparation* for what is to come, as we would prepare for a journey.

2. The *space_in_back_of_observer* in the source frame corresponds to *past_time* in the target frame. This connection suggests that the past is something that we have left behind, something we have moved away from. It implies a sense of *distance* and *separation* from the past, as well as a sense of *irreversibility*. Just as we cannot go back to a location we have passed, we cannot return to a time that has passed.

3. The *location_of_observer* in the source frame corresponds to *present_time* in the target frame. This connection implies that the present is where we are currently located, the point in time we are experiencing now. It suggests a sense of *immediacy* and *engagement* with the present, just as we would be engaged with our current location.

These metaphorical connections highlight the conceptual ties between time and space, suggesting that we understand and experience time in spatial terms. This metaphor also implies a sense of *linear progression* through time, as we would move along a path. It suggests that time is a *journey* that we are undertaking, with the future as our destination, the past as our origin, and the present as our current location. This journey is *unidirectional* and *continuous*, reflecting the irreversible and ongoing nature of time.";"space_in_front_of_observer; future_time; actively approaching; anticipation; preparation; space_in_back_of_observer; past_time; distance; separation; irreversibility; location_of_observer; present_time; immediacy; engagement; linear progression; journey; unidirectional; continuous"

The roles in the source frame, such as the size_of_amount_of_substance, substance, and amount_of_substance, are metaphorically connected to the roles in the target frame, such as extent_of_duration_of_time, time, and duration_of_time.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve the conceptualization of time as a tangible, measurable substance that can be accumulated, spent, or wasted, much like a physical substance. This metaphorical connection allows us to perceive and understand the abstract concept of time through the more concrete and familiar concept of substance.

The *size_of_amount_of_substance* in the source frame corresponds to the *extent_of_duration_of_time* in the target frame. This suggests that the quantity or volume of a substance is metaphorically linked to the length or duration of time. For instance, a large amount of sand in an hourglass would represent a long duration of time.

The *substance* role in the source frame is connected to the *time* role in the target frame. This implies that time, like a substance, can be perceived as a physical entity that flows or passes, as illustrated in the example ""The flow of time"".

The *amount_of_substance* role in the source frame is linked to the *duration_of_time* role in the target frame. This connection indicates that the quantity of a substance is metaphorically related to the span of time. The example ""Like sands through the hourglass so are the days of our lives"" from the Days of Our Lives TV show illustrates this connection, as the sand passing through the hourglass represents the passing of days.

The metaphor also implies the concept of *inevitability* and *irreversibility*. Just as a substance, once used or consumed, cannot be regained, time, once passed, cannot be retrieved. This metaphor thus encapsulates the human experience of time as a finite, inexorable flow, much like a substance that is steadily depleted.";"substance; time; size_of_amount_of_substance; extent_of_duration_of_time; substance; time; amount_of_substance; duration_of_time; inevitability; irreversibility"
171;TIME_IS_MONEY;Money;Time;amount;duration;"We spent all day at the fair ; Time-theft";"In the metaphor TIME_IS_MONEY, the source frame is Money and the target frame is Time. The source role is amount and the target role is duration. This metaphorical connection suggests that time, like money, is a *limited resource* that can be spent, saved, wasted, or invested.

The concept of *amount* in the source frame (Money) is linked to the concept of *duration* in the target frame (Time). This implies that just as we quantify money, we also quantify time. We measure time in terms of hours, minutes, and seconds, just as we measure money in terms of dollars, pounds, or euros. This connection highlights the *quantifiable nature* of both time and money.

The example ""We spent all day at the fair"" illustrates this metaphorical connection. Here, time is being treated as a resource that can be 'spent' just like money. The phrase ""Time-theft"" further emphasizes this connection, suggesting that wasting someone's time is akin to stealing their money. This highlights the *value* we place on time, similar to the value we place on money.

The underlying dynamics of this metaphor involve concepts such as *investment* and *return*. Just as we invest money with the expectation of a return, we invest time in activities or people, expecting some form of return, whether it's enjoyment, knowledge, or relationships.

The metaphor also encompasses nuances such as *opportunity cost* and *scarcity*. Just as spending money on one thing means not being able to spend it on something else, spending time on one activity means not having time for other activities. This reflects the concept of opportunity cost. Similarly, the idea that both time and money are limited resources highlights the concept of scarcity.

In conclusion, the metaphor TIME_IS_MONEY draws a parallel between the way we perceive, value, and use time and money. It underscores the *interchangeability* of these two resources in our cognitive framework, emphasizing their shared characteristics of *quantifiability*, *value*, *scarcity*, and *opportunity cost*.";"limited resource; amount; duration; quantifiable nature; value; investment; return; opportunity cost; scarcity; interchangeability; quantifiability; value; scarcity; opportunity cost"
172;TIME_PERIODS_ARE_CONTAINERS;Containment;Time;container;unit;My morning has been very full;"In the metaphor TIME_PERIODS_ARE_CONTAINERS, the source frame is Containment and the target frame is Time. The source role is the container, and the target role is a unit of time. The example given is ""My morning has been very full.""

The metaphorical connection between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame is that a unit of time (morning, in this case) is conceptualized as a container that can be filled with activities or events. This metaphor allows us to understand time in a more tangible, physical way, as something that can be occupied or filled, similar to a physical container.

The key concept here is *capacity*, which is inherent in the idea of a container. Just as a physical container has a limited capacity and can be filled to the brim, a unit of time also has a finite capacity in terms of the number of activities or events it can contain. This metaphor thus highlights the *limitations* and *boundaries* of time, which, like a container, cannot be expanded beyond its inherent capacity.

Another key concept is *organization*. Just as we organize objects within a container, we also organize events within a time period. This metaphor thus allows us to conceptualize the process of scheduling or planning our time as similar to arranging objects within a container.

The concept of *saturation* is also implicit in this metaphor. A full container implies that no more can be added without causing overflow. Similarly, a full morning implies that it has reached its capacity in terms of activities or events, and no more can be added without causing stress or overextension.

Finally, the concept of *value* can be extracted from this metaphor. Just as we value a container based on what it holds, we also value a unit of time based on the activities or events it contains. A 'full' morning, for instance, might be seen as valuable or productive because it has been filled with meaningful or important activities.";"capacity; limitations; boundaries; organization; saturation; value"

This metaphorical connection suggests that trust relationships, like buildings, require a solid foundation, stability, and integrity to stand strong.

The *building_stability* in the source role corresponds to the *relationship_status* in the target role. This implies that just as a building needs stability to withstand external forces, a trust relationship also needs stability to endure challenges and conflicts.

The *change_in_integrity* in the source role aligns with the *change_in_relationship_integrity* in the target role. This suggests that just as a building's integrity can be compromised by damage, a trust relationship can also be damaged by breaches of trust, leading to a change in the relationship's integrity.

The *building_integrity* in the source role corresponds to *relationship_intensity* in the target role. This implies that the structural integrity of a building is akin to the intensity of a trust relationship. A building with high integrity is strong and durable, just as a trust relationship with high intensity is strong and resilient.

The *builder* in the source role aligns with the *trusted_entity* in the target role. This suggests that the builder, who constructs and maintains the building, is metaphorically similar to the trusted entity, who builds and maintains the trust relationship.

The *building_framework* in the source role corresponds to the *trust_framework* in the target role. This implies that the framework of a building, which provides its structure, is akin to the trust framework, which provides the structure for a trust relationship.

The *base_support* in the source role aligns with the *basis_of_trust* in the target role. This suggests that the base support of a building, which provides foundational stability, is metaphorically similar to the basis of trust, which provides the foundational stability for a trust relationship.

The *foundation_material* in the source role corresponds to the *trust_emotion* in the target role. This implies that the material used to build the foundation of a building is akin to the emotion of trust, which forms the foundation of a trust relationship.

Lastly, the *building_whole* in the source role aligns with the *relationship* in the target role. This suggests that the entire building, with all its components working together, is metaphorically similar to a trust relationship, where all elements work together to create a strong bond.

This metaphor highlights the *complexity*, *interdependence*, and *fragility* of trust relationships. Just as a building requires careful construction and maintenance to remain standing, trust relationships require ongoing effort and care to remain strong and intact.";"building_stability; relationship_status; change_in_integrity; change_in_relationship_integrity; building_integrity; relationship_intensity; builder; trusted_entity; building_framework; trust_framework; base_support; basis_of_trust; foundation_material; trust_emotion; building_whole; relationship; complexity; interdependence; fragility"
174;UNCONSCIOUS_IS_DOWN;Verticality;Consciousness;supine_entity;unconscious_entity;He fell into a coma ;"In the metaphor UNCONSCIOUS_IS_DOWN, the source frame is Verticality and the target frame is Consciousness. The source role is the supine_entity, which is metaphorically linked to the target role, the unconscious_entity. The example provided, ""He fell into a coma Elise,"" illustrates this metaphorical connection.

The metaphor UNCONSCIOUS_IS_DOWN is built on the conceptual correlation between *vertical position* and *conscious state*. The supine_entity in the source frame represents a physical state of being down or low, often associated with rest, inactivity, or lack of control. This is metaphorically mapped onto the unconscious_entity in the target frame, which represents a mental state of unconsciousness, where the individual lacks awareness or control over their thoughts and actions.

The metaphor thus encapsulates the concept of *loss of control* and *inactivity*. Just as a person who is lying down (supine_entity) has limited mobility and control over their surroundings, a person who is unconscious (unconscious_entity) has no control over their mental processes or physical actions.

Moreover, the metaphor also implies a *transition* from a higher state to a lower state, both physically and mentally. This is evident in the example ""He fell into a coma Elise,"" where the act of falling signifies a transition from consciousness to unconsciousness, paralleling the physical transition from standing or sitting to lying down.

The metaphor also suggests a *passivity* and *vulnerability*. In the state of being down or unconscious, the individual is at the mercy of external forces, unable to actively engage with or respond to their environment. This vulnerability is inherent in both the physical state of lying down and the mental state of unconsciousness.

Lastly, the metaphor may also hint at the concept of *recovery or rest*. Just as lying down is often a precursor to sleep, which is a restorative process, unconsciousness can also be seen as a state where the mind is 'resting' or 'recharging', particularly in the context of a coma.

In conclusion, the metaphor UNCONSCIOUS_IS_DOWN draws on the conceptual ties between physical verticality and mental consciousness, encapsulating concepts such as *loss of control*, *transition*, *passivity*, *vulnerability*, and potentially *recovery or rest*.";"vertical position; conscious state; loss of control; inactivity; transition; passivity; vulnerability; recovery or rest; loss of control; transition; passivity; vulnerability; recovery or rest"

The roles in the source frame are grasped_object and grasping_person, which correspond to the roles in the target frame: understood_idea and understanding_person.

The metaphorical connection between these roles is that the act of physically grasping an object is likened to the mental process of understanding an idea. The grasping_person in the source frame is metaphorically linked to the understanding_person in the target frame. This suggests that the act of understanding is an active process, much like the physical act of grasping. The person must actively engage with the idea in order to understand it, just as one must actively grasp an object to hold it.

Similarly, the grasped_object in the source frame is metaphorically connected to the understood_idea in the target frame. This implies that the idea, like the object, is something tangible that can be held and examined. It suggests that understanding is not a passive absorption of information, but rather a process of actively engaging with an idea, turning it over, examining it from different angles, much like one would do with a physical object.

This metaphor also implies certain key concepts. One such concept is *control*. Just as a person has control over an object they are grasping, understanding an idea gives a person a sense of control over that idea. They can manipulate it, examine it, and use it as they see fit.

Another key concept is *tactility*. Just as grasping an object involves a tactile, sensory experience, understanding an idea involves a mental 'touch' or 'feel'. This suggests that understanding is not just a cognitive process, but also an experiential one.

Finally, the metaphor implies a concept of *effort*. Grasping an object requires physical effort, and similarly, understanding an idea requires mental effort. This highlights the active, effortful nature of understanding.

The examples provided, ""He just can't seem to grasp the concept"" and ""He got a good handle on the subject matter"", further illustrate these metaphorical connections and underlying concepts. In both cases, the act of understanding is likened to the physical act of grasping or handling an object, emphasizing the active, tactile, and effortful nature of understanding.";"control; tactility; effort"
176;VOTING_IS_SPEAKING;Speaking;Voting;speaker;voter;The voters of Dillon have clearly spoken;"In the metaphor VOTING_IS_SPEAKING, the source frame is Speaking and the target frame is Voting. The source role is the speaker, which is metaphorically linked to the target role, the voter. The example given, 'The voters of Dillon have clearly spoken', illustrates this metaphorical connection.

The key concept in this metaphor is *expression of opinion*. In the act of speaking, a speaker expresses their thoughts, ideas, or opinions. Similarly, in the act of voting, a voter expresses their political preference or stance. Thus, the act of voting is metaphorically seen as speaking, where the ballot is the *voice* of the voter.

Another important concept is *communication*. Speaking is a form of communication, where the speaker conveys a message to an audience. In the same way, voting is a form of communication, where the voter sends a message to the political system or society about their choice or preference.

The concept of *influence* also plays a crucial role in this metaphor. A speaker can influence the thoughts or actions of others through their words. Similarly, a voter can influence the outcome of an election and the direction of governance through their vote.

The metaphor also implies the concept of *responsibility*. Just as a speaker has the responsibility to express their thoughts accurately and respectfully, a voter has the responsibility to make informed decisions that can impact their community or nation.

Finally, the metaphor suggests a sense of *empowerment*. Speaking gives the speaker the power to express their thoughts and be heard. Similarly, voting gives the voter the power to participate in the democratic process and have a say in the governance of their society.

In summary, the metaphor VOTING_IS_SPEAKING encapsulates the concepts of *expression of opinion*, *communication*, *influence*, *responsibility*, and *empowerment*.";"expression of opinion; voice; communication; influence; responsibility; empowerment; expression of opinion; communication; influence; responsibility; empowerment"
177;WHOLES_ARE_CONTAINERS;Containing;Part_whole;"contents;container";"parts;whole";The book contains more than 150 recipes for cabbage;"In the metaphor WHOLES_ARE_CONTAINERS, the source frame is 'Containing' and the target frame is 'Part_whole'. The source roles are 'contents' and 'container', while the target roles are 'parts' and 'whole'. The example given is 'The book contains more than 150 recipes for cabbage'.

The metaphorical connection between the roles in the source frame and those in the target frame is that the 'container' in the source frame corresponds to the 'whole' in the target frame, and the 'contents' in the source frame correspond to the 'parts' in the target frame. This metaphorical connection suggests that a 'whole' can be conceptualized as a 'container' that 'contains' its 'parts', similar to how a physical container holds its contents.

The conceptual tie between these roles is the idea of *inclusion* and *encapsulation*. Just as a container includes and encapsulates its contents, a whole includes and encapsulates its parts. This metaphorical connection allows us to understand the relationship between a whole and its parts in a more concrete and tangible way.

Diving deeper into the metaphor, we can extract the concept of *organization*. Just as contents are organized within a container, parts are organized within a whole. This suggests that the whole is not just a sum of its parts, but an organized structure that gives meaning and context to its parts.

Another key concept is *boundary*. A container has a clear boundary that separates its contents from the outside world. Similarly, a whole has a boundary that separates its parts from other wholes. This concept of boundary helps us understand the distinction and unity of a whole.

Finally, the concept of *capacity* can be extracted. A container has a certain capacity that limits the amount of contents it can hold. Similarly, a whole has a capacity that limits the number of parts it can include. This concept of capacity can be used to understand the limitations and potential of a whole.

In conclusion, the metaphor WHOLES_ARE_CONTAINERS provides a rich conceptual framework for understanding the relationship between a whole and its parts, encompassing concepts such as *inclusion*, *encapsulation*, *organization*, *boundary*, and *capacity*.";"inclusion; encapsulation; organization; boundary; capacity; inclusion; encapsulation; organization; boundary; capacity"
178;WHOLES_ARE_POSSESSORS;Possession;Part_whole;"possess_relation;possession;possessor";"whole-part_relation;parts;whole";"The eye possesses several parts ; Which car part belongs to which car ";"In the given data, the metaphor is WHOLES_ARE_POSSESSORS. The source frame is Possession and the target frame is Part_whole. The roles in the source frame are possess_relation, possession, and possessor, while the roles in the target frame are whole-part_relation, parts, and whole.

The metaphorical connection between the source and target frames lies in the conceptualization of wholes as possessors of their parts. The *possession* in the source frame corresponds to the *parts* in the target frame. The *possessor* in the source frame corresponds to the *whole* in the target frame. The *possess_relation* in the source frame corresponds to the *whole-part_relation* in the target frame.

This metaphorical connection suggests that just as a possessor has ownership and control over their possessions, a whole is conceptualized as having a similar kind of ownership and control over its parts. This implies a sense of *inseparability* and *interdependence* between the whole and its parts, similar to the relationship between a possessor and their possessions.

The metaphor also implies a sense of *hierarchy* and *organization*, where the whole (or the possessor) is seen as superior or more significant than its parts (or possessions). This is similar to the hierarchical relationship between a possessor and their possessions in the source frame.

The examples provided, ""The eye possesses several parts"" and ""Which car part belongs to which car"", further illustrate this metaphorical connection. In these examples, the eye and the car are conceptualized as possessors that have ownership and control over their parts.

In conclusion, the metaphor WHOLES_ARE_POSSESSORS encapsulates the concepts of *inseparability*, *interdependence*, *hierarchy*, and *organization* in the relationship between a whole and its parts.";"possession; parts; possessor; whole; possess_relation; whole-part_relation; inseparability; interdependence; hierarchy; organization; inseparability; interdependence; hierarchy; organization"
179;WORDS_ARE_CONTAINERS;Containing;Word;"contents;container";"word_meaning;word_form";"That remark is completely impenetrable; Whatever Emily meant it's likely to be locked up in that cryptic little verse forever; He writes sentences in such a way as to seal up the meaning in them ";"In the metaphor WORDS_ARE_CONTAINERS, the source frame is Containing, with the roles of contents and container, and the target frame is Word, with the roles of word_meaning and word_form. The metaphorical connections between these roles can be understood as follows:

1. The *container* in the source frame corresponds to the *word_form* in the target frame. This connection suggests that words, like containers, have a form or structure that holds or encapsulates something within them.

2. The *contents* in the source frame corresponds to the *word_meaning* in the target frame. This connection implies that the meaning of a word is like the contents of a container, held within the form or structure of the word.

The conceptual ties between these roles can be understood as follows:

- The *encapsulation* of meaning within the form of a word is a key concept in this metaphor. Just as a container encapsulates its contents, the form of a word encapsulates its meaning. This encapsulation allows the meaning to be transported, shared, and understood, much like how a container allows its contents to be stored, transported, and used.

- The concept of *accessibility* is also implicit in this metaphor. Just as the contents of a container can be accessed or sealed off, the meaning of a word can be easily understood or remain impenetrable. This concept is highlighted in the examples, where phrases like ""completely impenetrable"" and ""locked up"" suggest that the meaning of the words or sentences is difficult to access or understand.

- The concept of *interpretation* is another key aspect of this metaphor. Just as the contents of a container can be interpreted in different ways depending on the viewer, the meaning of a word can be interpreted in different ways depending on the reader or listener. This concept is suggested in the example where Emily's verse is described as ""cryptic"", implying that its meaning is open to interpretation.

- Finally, the concept of *creation* is also implicit in this metaphor. Just as a container is created to hold certain contents, a word is formed to encapsulate a certain meaning. This concept is suggested in the example where the author ""writes sentences in such a way as to seal up the meaning in them"", implying that the author is creating words and sentences with specific meanings in mind.";"container; word_form; contents; word_meaning; encapsulation; accessibility; interpretation; creation"
